It holds a set of mapping set references, and can import other registries. MappingSet Represents a set of mappings MappingSetReference A reference to a mapping set. It allows to augment mapping set metadata from the perspective of the registry, for example, providing confidence, or a local filename or a grouping. Slots Slot Description author_id Identifies the persons or groups responsible for asserting the mappings. Recommended to be a (pipe-separated) list of ORCIDs or otherwise identifying URLs, but any identifying string (such as name and affiliation) is permissible. author_label A string identifying the author of this mapping. In the spirit of provenance, consider to use author_id instead. comment Free text field containing either curator notes or text generated by tool providing additional informative information. confidence A score between 0 and 1 to denote the confidence or probability that the match is correct, where 1 denotes total confidence. creator_id Identifies the persons or groups responsible for the creation of the mapping. The creator is the agent that put the mapping in its published form, which may be different from the author, which is a person that was actively involved in the assertion of the mapping.

Note that this is a convenience field that should be derivable from the mapping set. mapping_date The date the mapping was asserted. This is different from the date the mapping was published or compiled in a SSSOM file. mapping_justification A mapping justification is an action (or the written representation of that action) of showing a mapping to be right or reasonable. mapping_provider URL pointing to the source that provided the mapping, for example an ontology that already contains the mappings, or a database from which it was derived. mapping_registry_id The unique identifier of a mapping registry. mapping_set_description A description of the mapping set. mapping_set_group Set by the owners of the mapping registry. A way to group . mapping_set_id A globally unique identifier for the mapping set (not each individual mapping).

Mappings are frequently created on an ad-hoc basis, using simple two-column spreadsheets where the first column corresponds to the subject of the mapping, and the second column to the object of the mapping. This is insufficient for a variety of reasons: non-transparent precision: While the assumption is that the subject \"sort of mostly exactly\" maps to the object, in practice this is rarely the case. Matches can exact , where the subject corresponds 100% to the object, broad , where the object is broader than the subject, and others. Qualifiers like exact , broad , narrow , related and close qualify the precision of the mapping (not to be mistaken for fuzziness of confidence). Without knowing the precision, we cannot accurately transform our data, nor can we use the mappings to \"walk\", i.e. move from one mapping to another, see SSSOM 5-Star recommendation for mappings non-transparent incompleteness: We don't know when the mapping was created, on the basis of what version of the terminological source of the subject or object. As time passes, we also lose confidence whether there would now be more suitable mappings, or wether there are new terms that are now fully covered by the mappings. non-transparent confidence: whether a tool or a human propose the mapping, there is always a bit of a risk the mapping call may be wrong. As consumers of the mappings we need to know how confident the mapping authors were (confidence score), and why they confident (curation rules, mapping justification). Currently, mappings are created by a variety of systems, manually curated and automatic, and we need a way to efficiently collect and combine them. Mapping sets and mappings with quality provenance metadata allow us to trace faulty mappings to the source and correct them in a way that all users of the mapping set will profit from it. Is there a central repository of SSSOM files? The idea of a mapping commons is to provide mappings in a decentralised fashion akin to OBO ontologies. A mapping commons collects mappings relevant to a particular community, either by reference (i.e. pulling in mapping sets already published elsewhere), or directly maintained at the mapping commons ( example ). Their integration as part of a repository (mapping server) would look like EBI's Ontology X-ref Browser or BioPortal , but the exact scope of these repositories is use case dependent - EBI may chose to show cross references from and to ontologies loaded into OLS, while BioPortal chooses to show a different set of mappings. The plan is to update EBI's OxO to support the full SSSOM data model, drawing curated mappings from a variety of mapping commons, by Summer 2022 - but its unlikely that one central place will index all available mappings. Who is responsible for the conversion into SSSOM - the primary developers of an artefact, or a mapping commons? Like with everything on the web, the closer to the source the SSSOM mappings are curated, the better. Ideally, mappings are maintained as part of ontology release pipelines or by primary mapping creators, rather than derived from a secondary source such as a database, further downstream. The reason for this is that ideally, we would want mappings to be reviewable and editable in much the same way as open ontologies, offering issue trackers and an active community incorporating changes. That said, it is unlikely that all existing mappings will be maintained by the source directly. For example, we expect to maintain the SSSOM mappings derived from the vast majority of OBO ontology xrefs as a downstream task ( example ). How dependent are we on the sssom-py toolkit? SSSOM follows the core design principle that mapping tables should be (a) self-contained, i.e. including its prefix maps similar to a turtle file, and (b) readable by normal data science toolkits. An SSSOM table can be read with pandas using the comment='#' parameter (with one caveat, which is that # must be used as a character solely to denote comments), or a very simply combination of a yaml reader and pandas. The SSSOM toolkit however offers some extra functionality, like export to JSON-LD, or RDF or import from other frequently used format. Is the concept of a \"mapping server\" equivalent, complementary, or antagonistic to the existing ontology repositories? A (SSSOM) mapping server is a repository for mappings that enables the browsing of existing mappings, exposing all (or some relevant subset of) SSSOM metadata as search facets. In that sense, it should be considered complementary, as it enables the search for accurate mappings from a specific term or set of terms, something that goes beyond what most ontologies would offer. However, the concept of ontology mappings can be perceived as antagonistic to Open Ontology principles, as its goal is not the logical integration of knowledge, but the association or linking of terms across controlled semantic spaces . The OBO vision involves the building of a coherent, non-redundant semantic space of logically interconnected ontologies, which in particular wants to avoid the introduction of overlapping concepts. The mapping world specifically embraces heterogenous semantic spaces and overlapping concepts, and seeks to bridge the semantic gaps using well-defined mapping relations such as \"skos:broadMatch\" or \"owl:equivalentClass\".","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions-faq","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"},{"location":"faq/#why-should-our-mappings-be-fair-and-carefully-standardised","text":"Mappings are frequently created on an ad-hoc basis, using simple two-column spreadsheets where the first column corresponds to the subject of the mapping, and the second column to the object of the mapping.

For example, a computer program may be allowed to merge nodes in a knowledge graph only when they are skos:exactMatch , but not when they are, say, skos:closeMatch . Picking the right predicate to specify the meaning of your mapping is often a difficult process. The following guide should help you to understand the most widely used mapping predicates and when they are appropriate. Table of content The three primary concerns for selecting a mapping predicate The 3 step process for selecting an appropriate mapping predicate Frequently asked questions about mapping predicates Glossary subject : the entity that is being mapped object : the entity that the subject is mapped to predicate : the semantic mapping relationship used The three primary concerns for selecting a mapping predicate There are at least three things you need to decide before selecting an appropriate mapping predicate: Precision Acceptable degree of noise Intended use case What is the precision of the mapping? As a curator, you should try to investigate the intended meaning of both the subject and the object. This task usually involves trying to find out as much as possible about the mapped identifiers: What is their human readable definition? Are their any logical axioms that could help understanding the intended meaning? Sometimes, this even involves asking the respective stewards of the database or ontology for clarification. Important: The key here is \"intended meaning\", i.e. when you see FOODON:Apple (FOODON is an ontology), you do not try to figure out what an apple is , but what thing in the world (in your conceptual model of the world) the FOODON developers intended the FOODON:Apple identifier to refer to . This may be an Apple that you can eat. Or a cultivar ! The precision is simply: is the mapping exact , close , broad , narrow or related ? Here is an basic guide of how to think of each: exact : The two terms are intended to refer to the same thing. For example, both the subject and the object identifiers refer to the concept of Gala cultivar . close : The two terms are intended to refer to roughly the same thing, but not quite. This is a hazy category and should be avoided in practice, because when taken too literally, most mappings could be interpreted as close mappings. This is not the point of creating mappings, if their intention is to be useful (see \"use case\" considerations later in this document). An example of a close mapping is one between the \"heart\" concept in a database of anatomical entities for biological research on chimpanzees and the \"human heart\" in an electronic health record for humans. broad : The subject refers to a broader term. For example, \"human heart\" in an electronic health record refers to \"heart\" in a general anatomy ontology that covers all species, such as Uberon. Another example is \"Gala (cultivar)\" in one ontology or database to \"Apple (cultivar)\" in another: the Apple (cultivar) has a broader meaning then \"Gala (cultivar)\". For a good mapping, it is advisable that \"broad\" and \"narrow\" are applied a bit more strictly than is technically permitted by the SKOS specification: both the subject and the object should belong to the same category . For example, you should use broad (or narrow) only if both the subject and the object are \"cultivars\" (in the above example). narrow : The subject refers to a broader term. For example \"Apple (cultivar)\" is a narrow match to \"Gala (cultivar)\". Think of it as the opposite of \"broad\". broad and narrow are so called inverse categories: If \"Gala (cultivar)\" is a broad match to \"Apple (cultivar)\", then \"Apple (cultivar)\" is a narrow match to \"Gala (cultivar)\"! One note of caution : narrow matches generally have less useful applications then broad ones. For example, if we want to group subject entities in a database under an ontology to make them query-able in a knowledge graph, only broad matches to the ontology can be retrieved. For example, if we map \"Gala (cultivar)\" in a database to \"Apple (cultivar)\" in an ontology, and we wish to write a semantic query to obtain all records that are about \"Apple (cultivar)\" according to the ontology, we obtain \"Gala (cultivar)\". This is not true the other way around: if the ontology term is more specific then the database time, it cant be use the group the database data. related : The subject refers to an analogous concept of a different category. For example \"Apple\" and \"Apple tree\" are considered related matches, but not exact matches, as \"Apple\" is of the \"fruit\" category, and \"Apple tree\" of the \"tree\" category. Other examples include: \"disease\" and \"phenotype\", \"chemical\" and \"chemical exposure\", \"car\" and \"car manufacturing process\". In general, related mappings should be reserved for \"direct analogues\". For example, we should not try to map to related and broad categories at the same time, like, for example, \"Gala (cultivar)\" to \"Apple tree\". This causes a huge amount of proliferation of very \"low value\" mappings (see use case section later). What is the acceptable degree of noise of the mapping? Depending on what you want to do with your mappings, different quality levels are acceptable. This section is not exhaustive . \"Noise\" is the permissible margin of error for some target use case. While reading through this section, you should keep one things in mind: It is never a good idea to think about mappings as \"correct\" or \"wrong\". Even the the exact same identifier (for example in Wikidata, or even the biomedical data domain) can mean something very different depending on which database it is using it or in which part of which datamodel (or value set) they are used. Mapping should therefore be perceived as an inexact art where the goal is not \"correctness\" but \"fitness for purpose\": can the mappings deliver the use case I am interested in? In the following, we will take a closer look at the varying levels of noise you may need to weigh against each other. \"zero-noise\". Some mappings directly inform decision processes of downstream consumers, such as clinical decision support or manufacturing. For example, in an electronic health record (EHR) system we may want to know what the latest recommended drugs (or contra-indications) for a conditions are, and the disease-drugs relationships may be curated using one terminology such as OMOP , and the EHR may be represented using ICD10-CM (a clinical terminology used widely by hospitals). In these cases, noise should be zero or close to zero, as patient lives depend on the correctness of these mappings. \"low-noise\". Most mappings are used to augment/inform processes that are a bit upstream of the final consumer. For example, mappings are used to group data for analysis or make it easier to find related data during search (enhancing search indexing semantically). The final consumer does not immediately \"see\" the mappings, but they just see the consequences of applying the mappings. In these cases, a bit of noise may be acceptable, i.e. some mappings that are \"not quite right\". Practically, these os very often the case where data sources are aligned automatically to enable searches across, so a few bad mappings are better than having none. \"high-noise\": Some use cases employ data processing approaches that are themselves highly resilient to noise, like Machine Learning. Here, even a larger number of mappings (in a knowledge graph for example) which are \"not quite right\", or noisy, may be acceptable (if the signal to noise ratio is still ok, i.e. there are \"more good than bad\" mappings). There is no easy recipe by which you can decide what level of noise is acceptable. Your use case will determine this. What you, as the steward of your organisation's mapping data, should consider is that there is (roughly) an order of magnitude in cost involved between the three levels: \"high-noise\": Very cheap to generate. Automated matching tools can be used to generate the mappings, with no human review required. Your system may implement a way for your consumers to flag up bad results which can be traced back to a bad mapping, and simply exclude them moving forward, but generally. \"low-noise\": Moderately expensive. Most mappings are generated using automated matchers, but then confirmed by a human curator. The confirmation process can often be \"hand-wavy\" to weed out obviously bad mappings, but do not involve the same rigour as \"zero-noise\" mappings would require to maintain scalability to large volumes of mappings. Such a \"hand-wavy\" confirmative review can take 10 seconds to 100 seconds (if a quick look up is required). \"zero-noise\": Very expensive. Every mapping must be carefully reviewed by a human curator, sometimes by a group of curators. In our experience, reviewing or establishing a mapping like this (manually) can take anything between 10 and 30 minutes - occasionally more. You can use these estimated costs for mapping review to determine how much it would cost to apply the same level of rigour to your own mappings. What is the intended use case? This section is informative, not exhaustive, and will give you a sense of how use cases affect your choice of mapping predicate. We have covered some implications of use cases in the sections above: Some use cases require lower levels of noise , others can live with higher levels of noise. Mappings are rarely 100% exact when mapping across semantic spaces (different database, ontologies, terminologies). What matters is not \"correctness\" - what matters is that the mappings are \" fit for purpose \" (i.e. useful for your use case). Some mappings may be of more value for your use case than others (for example, exact mappings may be more valuable than broad mappings). You can find the right level of cost benefit by selecting optimising value and cost of generating/maintaining such mappings. close mappings may often have a very low value, but if your acceptable level of noise is high, just generate them, since they don't cost you anything! Other key considerations in the sections are: Semantic frameworks for analysis and querying Instance vs concept-level mapping Typical use cases Semantic frameworks for analysis and querying There are four semantic frameworks/formalisms that default SSSOM supports: (1) SPARQL/RDF(S) (querying an integrated knowledge with basic SPARQL); (2) Simple Knowledge organisation systems (SKOS) ; (3) Web Ontology Language (OWL) ; (4) no formalism (property graphs, non-semantic use cases). We will briefly discuss the implications of each for your use cases. SPARQL/RDF(S) is a very general semantic framework that allows query across property paths . Many SPARQL engines provide at least RDFS entailment regime, which allows for some (basic) semantic reasoning (subClassOf, property domains). This is the most likely semantic framework of choice if your use case involves semantic queries such as those involving sub-class groupings. SKOS is semantic framework that layers on top of RDF and specifies semantics for a handful of properties that are useful for building taxonomies that do not seek to follow the rigorous semantics of the class-level modelling constructs such as subClassOf. We have no experience with SKOS reasoners, and do not know if there are any out there. This means, in effect, that this \"case\" (semantic framework) has the same exact considerations as the SPARQL/RDF(S) one above. OWL is a very powerful semantic framework that is based on formal logic. Ontologies represented in OWL offer support for complex expressions of knowledge, way beyond what RDFS and SKOS can do. OWL is the semantic framework of choice if the goal is to build and reason over an integrated (merged) ontology. An example use case where OWL is the appropriate framework is integration of species-specific anatomy ontologies under species-neutral ones, see for example Uberon . A basic rule of thumb is: unless you know positively that you have to reason over the merged graph, i.e. set of all ontologies you have mapped across, OWL is probably overkill and should be avoided. Using no semantic framework does not mean semantic mappings are useless! Many extremely useful applications exist for mappings which do not involve a semantic framework, such as those related to Labelled Property Graphs (for example neo4j ). Even if you just want to translate your data into a graph, it is useful to know the semantics of your mappings as they can inform your graph queries. Other semantic frameworks exists such as rule-based systems (e.g. Datalog, SWRL), but they are not used as widely as the above in our domain. Instance vs Property vs Concept-level mapping To pick the correct mapping predicated, it is furthermore important to understand whether you are mapping concepts or instances: Concept-level: the entity being mapped constitutes a class or a concept. A concept can be thought of a collection or set of individuals. For example, \"Apple\" could refer to the class of all apples. Instance-level: the entity being mapped constitutes an individual or an instance. An instance is a single real world entity, such as Barack Obama. Instances are members of classes/concepts. For example, Barack Obama belongs to the class of \"Person\", or \"Former Presidents\". Another example is an individual apple on a shelf in a supermarket (\"Gala Apple 199999\"), which is an instance of the \"Apple\" class. Note that notions like broad or narrow make no sense when mapping instances. We typically try to avoid the SKOS vocabulary for mapping instances, and make use of owl:sameAs instead. Note that owl:sameAs does have implications for reasoning, but it is also the preferred property when within the \"RDF/SPARQL\" semantic framework. If the mapping involves an instance and a class, you have hit a corner case of the SSSOM use case. This case can still be represented, but instance-concept relationships are not widely thought of as \"mappings\". In much the same way as concepts and instances, you can also map properties, (or \"properties\", or \"relationships\"): Property-level: the entities being mapped are both properties, like, for example, rdfs:label, skos:prefLabel, RO:0000050 (part of). Note that it does not make sense to try and map instances of concepts, or concepts, directly to properties. There are no relationships that would support such a mapping. Typical use cases Typical use cases for mappings include: Semantic data integration . This often involves linking data to ontologies or semantic layers in knowledge graphs. Data from one source (such as an EHR) is translated to another (such as OMOP, see above). To analyse the data semantically, the most valuable links are exact and broad as these allow you to directly query the ontology to retrieve instance data. close and narrow matches are less useful for such a use case, but maybe be consulted as the \"next best thing\" to an exact mapping. Often, a low level of noise is acceptable. Data translation . Similar to data integration, but we want to map as precisely as possible. Only exact matches really matter if we want to make sure that data annotated with one ontology means the exact same thing as data annotated with another. Noise in the mappings is often not acceptable. An example for this is if one source has annotated all its genes using the Huge Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) while another is using NCBI Gene Database identifiers. broad , narrow and even close matches are mostly meaningless - we need a 1:1 translation table with next to zero noise. Ontology and knowledge graph merging . Here, the key issue is that exact matches matches have as little noise as possible. Some merging approaches use probabilistic algorithms to weed out out potentially bad mappings (low levels of noise may be acceptable, see for example boomer ), but any naive merging approach, which is still prevalent in the knowledge graph world, will usually do the following: (1) Merge all exact matches into one \"node\" in the knowledge graph and (2) redirect all data against all these exact matches to that newly created node. The 3-step process for selecting an appropriate mapping predicate The following 10-step process condenses the sections above into a simple to follow algorithm. Given two terms A and B: Target: semantic framework: Does your use case require OWL reasoning over the merged subject and object sources? If yes, use OWL vocabulary for properties If no, use RDF/SPARQL/SKOS vocabulary for properties Are A and B instances, properties or concepts? If A and B are instances use only vocabulary suitable for instances If A and B are concepts, use only vocabulary suitable for concepts If A and B are properties, use only vocabulary suitable for properties If either one of A or B is an instance and the other is a concept, use only vocabulary suitable for describing instance-class relationships Is A roughly the same with B? If yes, does the difference between \"truly exact\" and your understanding of A and B constitute \"acceptable noise level\"? If yes: the mapping is exact . If no: the mapping is close . If no, determine if the precision as described above. You can now select the mapping predicate based on the table below: Mapping Predicate Precision Suitable for semantic framework Suitable entity types? Acceptable noise skos:exactMatch exact SKOS/RDF(S)/SPARQL/NO Concept low skos:relatedMatch related SKOS/RDF(S)/SPARQL/NO Concept low skos:broadMatch broad SKOS/RDF(S)/SPARQL/NO Concept low skos:narrowMatch narrow SKOS/RDF(S)/SPARQL/NO Concept low skos:closeMatch close SKOS/RDF(S)/SPARQL/NO Concept low owl:sameAs exact SKOS/RDF(S)/SPARQL/OWL/NO Instance low owl:equivalentClass exact OWL Concept no rdfs:subClassOf broad RDF(S)/SPARQL/OWL Concept no owl:equivalentProperty exact OWL Property no rdfs:subPropertyOf broad OWL Property no oboInOwl:hasDbXref exact SKOS/RDF(S)/SPARQL Any high rdfs:seeAlso close SKOS/RDF(S)/SPARQL Any high rdf:type exact/broad RDF(S)/SPARQL/OWL Instance-Concept no Note that \"acceptable noise\" refers to \"what is acceptable for the target semantic framework\". When using OWL, even a bit of noise can have huge consequences for reasoning, so it is not advisable to use the OWL vocabulary in cases were there is a lot of noise. Frequently asked questions None of the mapping predicates listed here seem to fit for my use case. Can I define my own? The SSSOM specification is currently open to specifying new mapping predicates. However, it is always advisable to open an issue to discuss such cases with the wider community - there may be some benefit in standardising predicates from the start!","title":"How to use mapping predicates"},{"location":"mapping-predicates/#how-to-pick-the-right-mapping-predicates","text":"A mapping predicate such as skos:exactMatch species the semantics of the mapping relation - in other words, it defines how a computer (and human!) should interpret the mapping when it is being used.

Note that it does not make sense to try and map instances of concepts, or concepts, directly to properties. There are no relationships that would support such a mapping.","title":"Instance vs Property vs Concept-level mapping"},{"location":"mapping-predicates/#typical-use-cases","text":"Typical use cases for mappings include: Semantic data integration . This often involves linking data to ontologies or semantic layers in knowledge graphs. Data from one source (such as an EHR) is translated to another (such as OMOP, see above). To analyse the data semantically, the most valuable links are exact and broad as these allow you to directly query the ontology to retrieve instance data. close and narrow matches are less useful for such a use case, but maybe be consulted as the \"next best thing\" to an exact mapping. Often, a low level of noise is acceptable. Data translation . Similar to data integration, but we want to map as precisely as possible. Only exact matches really matter if we want to make sure that data annotated with one ontology means the exact same thing as data annotated with another. Noise in the mappings is often not acceptable. An example for this is if one source has annotated all its genes using the Huge Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) while another is using NCBI Gene Database identifiers. broad , narrow and even close matches are mostly meaningless - we need a 1:1 translation table with next to zero noise. Ontology and knowledge graph merging . Here, the key issue is that exact matches matches have as little noise as possible. Some merging approaches use probabilistic algorithms to weed out out potentially bad mappings (low levels of noise may be acceptable, see for example boomer ), but any naive merging approach, which is still prevalent in the knowledge graph world, will usually do the following: (1) Merge all exact matches into one \"node\" in the knowledge graph and (2) redirect all data against all these exact matches to that newly created node.","title":"Typical use cases"},{"location":"mapping-predicates/#the-3-step-process-for-selecting-an-appropriate-mapping-predicate","text":"The following 10-step process condenses the sections above into a simple to follow algorithm.

SSSOM seeks to solve, in particular, the following problems: Standardising the mapping metadata that is necessary to drive data transformation and knowledge graph merging use cases Enable effective merging and filtering of mapping sets Standardising the representation of mapping sets across formats such as RDF/XML, JSON-LD, TSV, and others. The purpose of this 3-hour workshop: Describing current use cases to the community, and ensuring all community use cases are documented and understood Establishing a user forum for getting support and providing feedback Define a simple governance strategy for organic evolution of standard Describing a number of key open issues: The representation of complex mappings The representation of curation rules The problem of predicate modification The alignment with external standards such as PROV-O and Alignment API Defining the path to a SSSOM beta release (stable) and the rallying for the paper Resources : Overview presentation Outcomes Members of the SSSOM core team are organised as as github team: https://github.com/orgs/mapping-commons/teams/sssom-core If you want to become a member, please make an issue here: https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues We added some of the questions asked to the new SSSOM FAQ: https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/faq/ Governance proposal (comments welcome): https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues/82 Governance will evolve over time. Standard and governance will evolve together. We will versioning (like SemVer) and should denote when backwards incompatible changes happen The 5-Star system for open FAIR mappings is now in its first official version. Discussion summary Ben Gyori: would be interesting to discuss beyond the format whether there's a central repository, or whether primary developers will make it as a primary export hosted along with their other artifact. Would there be a process to pull those? Nico: takes a long time for uptake of new publication systems, so this could take a long time -> maybe better to promote on an ontology level. Could also have the side benefit of providing a point of introspection John G: I totally would want BioPortal to be capable of managing the RDF produced from SSSOM resources, and for Bioportal to be a mapping resource and not simply an ontology resource. I suspect the RDF patterns that SSSOM is defining are the gold we'll need for that gold standard for exchanging mappings. Uploading the RDF files can trivially be done in a naive way of course, but integrating that RDF knowledge into Bioportal to make them maximally useful as a separate kind of resource is obviously 'real work' (and so schedules are unknowable). John: how dependent is the library on the software itself? Is it an exchange principle? Nico: LinkML has the advantage that it gets JSON and TTL outputs for free if we use it. Would also be advantageous if more people used this standard for metamodeling to create similar outputs for different modeling Charlie: using \"frontmatter\" format for SSSOM TSV files, like how github is using frontmatter in Jekyll (ref: https://blog.datacite.org/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv/) (http://csvy.org/) John G: Analogous to frontmatter format, I keep being drawn to the SKOS Play format as an alternate (but I think TTL-compatible) format for the SSSOM content. How bad would that be? (I can create a ticket) Charlie: Requirements for a default JSON-LD context (e.g., prefix -> URL prefix mapping) How should it be maintained? Should it continue to be manually curated, or is an automated export from something like the Bioregistry a good idea? If it's automatically exported from the Bioregistry, what kinds of interactions might users want to have via the Bioregistry issue tracker to propose improvements? Similarly, we can make tutorials for directly creating PRs. Charlie: How prefixes should be stylized/what is the business logic/decision tree for using OBO Library PURLs, Identifiers.org URLs, Bioregistry URLs, first-party provider URLs, etc. based on what's available and mapped between various first-party providers, third-party providers (e.g., ChemSpider InChI resolver), and meta-providers (e.g., Identifiers.org, OntoBee)? This is both a concern for \"best practices\" in SSSOM defining a custom context and also when using or extending the default context. Charlie: How to represent mappings where the curator is unsure if the relation is correct or not? This happens often when curating equivalences, e.g., in Biomappings https://github.com/biomappings/biomappings/blob/master/src/biomappings/resources/unsure.tsv Tiffany: Is it important to know why someone feels more or less confident about a mapping? If so, is there also a way to include that in the measure of \u201cconfidence\u201d? Sue: In practice I\u2019ve tended to add comments when I am uncertain and have questions. Possibly this could be formalized? Davera clinical use case discussion: Overall issue: mapping sets of things to a term is a goal for clinical mappings mapping recommendations/rational exercise staging and diagnosis information (like stage 1 or stage 2 of a given cancer) Select a set of stages - this is challenging wrt mappings Different kinds of scales describing the same thing are hard/sometimes not \"kosher\" to mix Phenotypes rely on capturing human-readable data on the decision logic of how mappings are applied by standards implementation team Proposed to look at the HL7 Implementation profiles as a way to incorporate an approach to this complex mapping challenge Melissa: rename SSSOM to Slytherin Standard. Charlie 100% supports this (Tiffany: +1; Alex +1) Kristin also likes this. John used it. John G: Ontology repositories are mappings-motivated, to both provide to users good mappings, and to provide good ways for users or managers to ingest, manage, apply, and create mapping knowledge. Ontology repositories are presumably also capable of storing mappings in their semantic (RDF-equivalent) format. With this in mind, is the concept of a \"mapping server\" equivalent, complementary, or antagonistic to the existing ontology repositories? John G: Need to consider identification and versioning of the mapping artifacts. It's one thing to say \"We have all the mapping artifacts and we are giving those out\", but (just like ontologies) citing a mapping artifact requires that you have a unique identifier for that artifact, and that the identifier incorporates the fact the artifact may have multiple versions. Ideally the SSSOM artifacts (like ontologies) would (a) be accessible in a defined format at the identifier IRI, (b) include their identifiers within the SSMOC artifact. I am thinking that an SSMOC is inherently a semantic artifact, and therefore it should follow semantic namespace declaration principles in this regard. Julie: W3id supports regex based redirects (for purls) Breakout sessions Curation rules: documenting the decision rules on how a mapping was determined Effective definition of inclusion criteria/exclusion criteria: Inclusion example: Two ontologies saying I created exact mappings that they have a string match or a string match to a synonym + an xref Exclusion example: Only matched on an acronym Match types Cover partial string matches Other documentation criteria to distinguish exact from narrow/broad - how exact is exact Line between close/narrow/broad Direction of narrow and broad DOS: I'd favor manual mapping be done on definitions + context in ontology, leaving lexical mappings to machines. What metadata could we add to the header to make clear criteria used? One thing it might be useful to record is whether ontology context (relationships & location in classification) of mapped terms was used (Some ontologies/taxonomies have poor quality graphs but high quality term definitions.) Source string match to target (lexical exact, stem, word [synonym and type]) - need for both source and target, how to synonyms fit in Needs: Generalized patterns that relate file header information to row-level information Need more expressivity in the match type Inclusion and exclusion criteria Best practices guide Algorithm/tool/similarity measure for computationally derived mappings Specificity with respect to the parent concept or portion of the hierarchy that the concept is from Mapping provenance and alignment with external provenance standards Problems: We need to distinguish original and derived mappings We need to somehow \u201cencode\u201d how a derived mapping was created (for example through a walk USeful to capture as part of the PROV activity agents (wasAssociatedWith some) mapping tool creator algorithms semantic similarity etc Why provenance: \u201ci dont trust mappings from source x..\u201d Who did it?

Minimum should be something like: Creator, creation date, algorithm,... see below \u201clist of critical (minimum) prov information\u201d John: World is changing we can assume a bit more complexity All: A short list of the critical provenance information is needed, but there should also be a mechanism to add other ecosystem-specific provenance. Versioning: We need to carefully think through versioning of mapping sets. Versioning should be similar to ontology artefacts, with version IRIs and PURLs W3id supports regex based redirects We need to introduce versioning for the SSSOM standard itself. Someway to indicate whether breaking changes were introduced Representing predicate modification: negation, inverse, direct, indirect etc https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/issues/40 Negative mappings (e.g., not equivalent to, not related to) have a clear use case in supporting semi-automated curation of mappings to avoid zombie mappings. We agreed adding additional syntax to SSSOM would make it less simple and likely less accessible. Two candidate solutions for including negative mappings remain: curating a controlled vocabulary of negative relationships (e.g., sssom:notEquivalentTo) OR adding a predicated modifier column. We considered parallel discussions in the LinkML community and examined the use of predicate modifiers in the Gene Ontology Annotation database.

SSSOM seeks to solve, in particular, the following problems: Standardising the mapping metadata that is necessary to drive data transformation and knowledge graph merging use cases Enable effective merging and filtering of mapping sets Standardising the representation of mapping sets across formats such as RDF/XML, JSON-LD, TSV, and others. The purpose of this 3-hour workshop: Describing current use cases to the community, and ensuring all community use cases are documented and understood Establishing a user forum for getting support and providing feedback Define a simple governance strategy for organic evolution of standard Describing a number of key open issues: The representation of complex mappings The representation of curation rules The problem of predicate modification The alignment with external standards such as PROV-O and Alignment API Defining the path to a SSSOM beta release (stable) and the rallying for the paper Resources : Overview presentation","title":"1st Mapping Commons Workshop on Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings"},{"location":"mc2021/#outcomes","text":"Members of the SSSOM core team are organised as as github team: https://github.com/orgs/mapping-commons/teams/sssom-core If you want to become a member, please make an issue here: https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues We added some of the questions asked to the new SSSOM FAQ: https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/faq/ Governance proposal (comments welcome): https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues/82 Governance will evolve over time.

Would there be a process to pull those? Nico: takes a long time for uptake of new publication systems, so this could take a long time -> maybe better to promote on an ontology level. Could also have the side benefit of providing a point of introspection John G: I totally would want BioPortal to be capable of managing the RDF produced from SSSOM resources, and for Bioportal to be a mapping resource and not simply an ontology resource. I suspect the RDF patterns that SSSOM is defining are the gold we'll need for that gold standard for exchanging mappings. Uploading the RDF files can trivially be done in a naive way of course, but integrating that RDF knowledge into Bioportal to make them maximally useful as a separate kind of resource is obviously 'real work' (and so schedules are unknowable). John: how dependent is the library on the software itself? Is it an exchange principle? Nico: LinkML has the advantage that it gets JSON and TTL outputs for free if we use it. Would also be advantageous if more people used this standard for metamodeling to create similar outputs for different modeling Charlie: using \"frontmatter\" format for SSSOM TSV files, like how github is using frontmatter in Jekyll (ref: https://blog.datacite.org/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv/) (http://csvy.org/) John G: Analogous to frontmatter format, I keep being drawn to the SKOS Play format as an alternate (but I think TTL-compatible) format for the SSSOM content. How bad would that be? (I can create a ticket) Charlie: Requirements for a default JSON-LD context (e.g., prefix -> URL prefix mapping) How should it be maintained? Should it continue to be manually curated, or is an automated export from something like the Bioregistry a good idea? If it's automatically exported from the Bioregistry, what kinds of interactions might users want to have via the Bioregistry issue tracker to propose improvements? Similarly, we can make tutorials for directly creating PRs. Charlie: How prefixes should be stylized/what is the business logic/decision tree for using OBO Library PURLs, Identifiers.org URLs, Bioregistry URLs, first-party provider URLs, etc. based on what's available and mapped between various first-party providers, third-party providers (e.g., ChemSpider InChI resolver), and meta-providers (e.g., Identifiers.org, OntoBee)? This is both a concern for \"best practices\" in SSSOM defining a custom context and also when using or extending the default context. Charlie: How to represent mappings where the curator is unsure if the relation is correct or not? This happens often when curating equivalences, e.g., in Biomappings https://github.com/biomappings/biomappings/blob/master/src/biomappings/resources/unsure.tsv Tiffany: Is it important to know why someone feels more or less confident about a mapping? If so, is there also a way to include that in the measure of \u201cconfidence\u201d? Sue: In practice I\u2019ve tended to add comments when I am uncertain and have questions. Possibly this could be formalized? Davera clinical use case discussion: Overall issue: mapping sets of things to a term is a goal for clinical mappings mapping recommendations/rational exercise staging and diagnosis information (like stage 1 or stage 2 of a given cancer) Select a set of stages - this is challenging wrt mappings Different kinds of scales describing the same thing are hard/sometimes not \"kosher\" to mix Phenotypes rely on capturing human-readable data on the decision logic of how mappings are applied by standards implementation team Proposed to look at the HL7 Implementation profiles as a way to incorporate an approach to this complex mapping challenge Melissa: rename SSSOM to Slytherin Standard. Charlie 100% supports this (Tiffany: +1; Alex +1) Kristin also likes this. John used it. John G: Ontology repositories are mappings-motivated, to both provide to users good mappings, and to provide good ways for users or managers to ingest, manage, apply, and create mapping knowledge. Ontology repositories are presumably also capable of storing mappings in their semantic (RDF-equivalent) format. With this in mind, is the concept of a \"mapping server\" equivalent, complementary, or antagonistic to the existing ontology repositories? John G: Need to consider identification and versioning of the mapping artifacts. It's one thing to say \"We have all the mapping artifacts and we are giving those out\", but (just like ontologies) citing a mapping artifact requires that you have a unique identifier for that artifact, and that the identifier incorporates the fact the artifact may have multiple versions. Ideally the SSSOM artifacts (like ontologies) would (a) be accessible in a defined format at the identifier IRI, (b) include their identifiers within the SSMOC artifact. I am thinking that an SSMOC is inherently a semantic artifact, and therefore it should follow semantic namespace declaration principles in this regard.

However, there is currently little to no standardisation in how such mappings are represented. While properties such as hasDbXref property are widely used in ontologies such as GO and MONDO, the meaning of such mappings is unclear, and cannot be further described with additional metadata or provenance. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) is an initiative to provide a minimal and standard set of elements for the dissemination of mappings between ontology terms, to ensure a reliable interpretation of generated mappings and to enable sharing and data integration between people and applications. This document introduces the SSSOM catalog of metadata elements, which can be used to attach meta- and provenance data to both mappings and sets of mappings; a controlled vocabulary for the description of match types (SSSOM CV); a definition of both RDF and TSV serialisations of ontology mappings; and a (non-exhaustive) selection of recommended mapping predicates. Table of Contents Introduction SSSOM Metadata Elements SSSOM Common Predicates SSSOM Serialisation SSSOM Use Cases SSSOM 5-Star recommendation for mappings Introduction Currently, there are three methods typically used to express mappings in OWL: direct logical axioms using owl:equivalentClass; the oboInOwl hasDbXref property; and the SKOS vocabulary for mapping properties. The first, owl:equivalentClass, is a strong logical equivalence assertion which is not appropriate for more nuanced mappings such as close matches. The second, hasDbXref, does not assert formal logical equivalence but also has no clearly defined meaning. Finally, the SKOS vocabulary provides a hierarchy of mapping properties which allow the unambigous specification of exact, close, broad, and narrow matches, but does not provide the means for mappings to be annotated with additional metadata such as confidence scores and provenance. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) addresses these problems by defining a catalog of metadata terms to describe mappings. Both individual mappings and sets of mappings can be described, enabling provenance and metadata to be captured on multiple levels. SSSOM interoperates with existing methods for the specification of mappings, allowing any predicate to be used to describe the nature of each mapping including those from OWL and SKOS. The provenance of mappings - such as whether the mapping was created as the result of a human-curated equivalence match, or a semantic similarity match - is specified using a controlled vocabulary (CV), SSSOM CV. Combined with the metadata properties provided by SSSOM such as confidence and semantic_similarity_score, this provenance information can be used to capture mapping descriptions in a manner that is explicit and amenable to curation. Two serialisations for SSSOM mappings are provided in this document, aimed at different communities: an RDF/OWL serialisation using IRIs that is aimed at the Knowledge Graph/Semantic Web community, and a TSV serialisation using CURIE syntax which is aimed at the wider bioinformatics community. An unambiguous translation between these serialisations is provided. Challenges for exchange and use of mappings Despite their importance for data integration, term mappings are typically neglected as data artefacts (57). A mapping in this context is a correspondence between two terms, referred to here as \"subject\" and \"object\" terms. A \"predicate\" defines the type of relationship between the subject and the object, such as skos:exactMatch, or owl:equivalentClass. A mapping, or \"match\", does not have to be exact: it can be broad, e.g. between a conceptually narrow term such as \"Red Delicious\" and a conceptually broader term such as \"Apple\". To our knowledge, no formal review has been published that analyzes the representation and formats used for collections of term mappings (mapping sets, or alignments), but in our experience, most mapping sets are represented as tables using an ad-hoc \"schema\", often merely a simple two-column format that lists matching terms in two naming schemes. An example of such a table can be seen in the following Table. Subject Object UBERON:0002101 FMA:24875 UBERON:0000019 FMA:54448 Table 1: An example of a typical mapping table one might find on the web. This type of table lacks clear semantics and is therefore very difficult to use and re-use either by humans or by machines. We will discuss a few of the most critical problems in the sections that follow. Non-transparent imprecision . Mapping precision describes, usually qualitatively, whether a mapping between a subject and an object is exact, broad, narrow, close or related. An exact mapping means that the subject term can be replaced with the object term and vice versa, i.e. they refer to the exact same real-world entity. A broad mapping links a subject term to a more general term, for example, the term \"leg\" to the term \"hindlimb\" (if the ontology defines leg as the parts of the hindlimb that exclude the foot). A narrow mapping links a subject term to a more specific term. For example, \"long QT syndrome\" in the Mondo Disease Ontology is a narrow match to \"Romano-Ward long QT syndrome\" in Orphanet. A close mapping relates two terms that are neither exact, broad or narrow, but belong to the same category of things and are semantically similar, such as \"apple\" to \"pear\", or \"paw\" to \"hand\". Due to its subjective nature (\"what is close?\"), this is a problematic category of mapping, but it is widely used, for example for relating similar anatomical terms across species. Related mappings are mappings across categories of things, such as the mapping between a phenotype \"enlarged liver\" and the anatomical entity \"liver\". In practice, it is rare that mapping tables such as the one presented in Table 1 constitute a set of purely \"exact\" matches. Different use cases may require different levels of mapping precision. For example, for entity merging (defined as the process of merging two entities from different sources into one) or data translation (defined as the process of moving annotations from using one ontology to another), exact mappings may be required, while for data grouping broad matches are often sufficient (ensuring that the subject is classified under the object term). For many machine learning use cases, close and related matches will be extremely useful regardless of their lack of semantic precision (though semantic precision is likely to improve predictive power). In practice, many mappings are to varying degrees imprecise but do not specify the mapping precision. This makes it impossible to reliably apply them to use cases such as entity merging or data translation. Non-transparent accuracy, confidence, and provenance . To scale to real-world use cases, automated tools are critical for matching terms across databases, terminologies and ontologies. Such tools typically implement mapping rules that determine whether a given pair of terms constitutes a match. For example, label matching rules might include \"match if subject and object labels match\", \"match if subject label matches with an exact synonym of the object\" and \"match if subject and object exhibit a very high degree of semantic similarity\". Depending on the rules, tools will have more or less confidence that a match constitutes a mapping. Even human curators often have different levels of confidence about the accuracy of any given mapping, especially if the process of determining whether a mapping is accurate involves the review of (often complex) descriptions and term definitions. Different use cases will profit from different degrees of accuracy. For example, if we seek to integrate data from various medical terminologies to inform medical diagnosis, we may require not only a very high degree of confidence about the mapping but also ensure that the mapping is \"explainable\" to users. To ensure that diagnostic decisions that require bridging of data silos through mappings are explainable, we furthermore need provenance (documentation of where a piece of data comes from and how it was produced), such as an explicit statement of the mapping rules by which the match was originally determined (for example, the labels of both terms could have been the same). Thanks to efforts by initiatives such as the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), many mapping tables on the web include at least a confidence score. However, in our experience, mapping rules are rarely stated explicitly as part of the mappings or mapping set metadata. Many mappings in the wild are to varying degrees inaccurate, but without a confidence score and explicit mapping rules, this inaccuracy will not be transparent. Non-transparent incompleteness . Mapping sets can be incomplete for (at least) three major reasons: (1) they are out of date, i.e. a term in one ontology was removed (deprecated) in a later version of the ontology or a term with a more precise mapping was introduced; (2) they are deliberately partial, i.e. covering only a subset of terms, which were mapped for a specific purpose (for example a manual effort to map all COVID-19-relevant phenotypes from the Human Phenotype Ontology to the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology); or (3) they accidentally omit certain correct mappings, as the automated approaches that were used did not detect them (false negatives). We cannot determine whether a mapping set such as the one given in Table X1 is up-to-date, deliberately partial or accidentally incomplete without sufficient metadata about the purpose of the mappings, the tools used and the version of the source data used for the matching process. UnFAIRness . The FAIR principles are a set of community-developed guidelines to ensure that data or any digital object are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Unlike many of the widely used controlled vocabularies, ontologies and data schemas, mappings are rarely published using standard formats and metadata vocabularies and can therefore be considered second class citizens in the world of FAIR semantics. While some tools exist to browse mappings (the F and A in FAIR, findable and accessible), such as OxO and BioPortal, they lack access to at least some of the metadata required to determine their applicability for a use case: Are mappings likely to be correct? Are they precise enough? Have they been updated recently? Can I trust the authority that generated the mappings? While some minimum level of interoperability (the I in FAIR) is achieved simply by publishing the mappings as RDF triples (which rarely happens in practice), most mappings are best captured in the form of simple tables (in our experience the preferred format for both mapping curators and data engineers). Furthermore, the predicates or relations used in the mappings are far from standardized. Different relations have different semantics, ranging from strong logical relations such as owl:sameAs or owl:equivalentClass to predicates with no formally specified semantics such as oboInOwl:hasDbXref. In our experience, reusability (the R in FAIR) is a significant obstacle to FAIRness. It is infeasible to simply reuse existing mappings without the metadata required to make imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness explicit. Repositories such as OxO and BioPortal cannot make mappings more accessible, because the metadata required to do so simply does not exist. In order to gradually improve our mappings and make them FAIRer, we need to be able to share, review, fix and maintain our mappings in much the same way as our ontologies themselves - using standard formats and rich metadata. FAIRifying data is an effort that aims to supply practical solutions for the use of the FAIR guiding principles throughout the research data life cycle. It recommends technologies that support semantic interoperability in a sustainable way, and practices that support FAIRness. The FAIRSemantics effort is currently discussing how to incorporate semantic mappings, and we reached out to them to consider SSSOM for this purpose. Background about mappings A mapping can be defined as a triple , where s is the subject of the mapping, p is the mapping predicate (or relation) and o is the object. There are many different mapping predicates used in practice, but they are not always standardized. The Semantic Web community uses a number of standard mapping predicates, such as owl:sameAs or owl:equivalentClass (logical mapping predicates) and skos:exactMatch or skos:broadMatch (terminological mapping predicates). We refer to mapping subjects and objects as \"terms\", which we will loosely define here as a set of symbols that define some entity in the real world. Usually, a term can be referred to by an identifier that uniquely identifies some entity in a certain context. For example, UBERON:0002101 is the identifier for a term that refers to the anatomical entity \"limb\". Putting it all together, the mapping describes a correspondence in which the term with the id UBERON:0002101 constitutes a terminological exact match to the term with the identifier FMA:24875. Mappings between data model elements, databases and other representations can be described similarly. Note that we generally use the terms \"matching\" and \"mapping\" interchangeably. Occasionally we refer to \"matching\" as the process to determine a mapping candidate (lexical matching, logical matching etc), a \"match\" as the result of the matching process, and a \"mapping\" the process and result of the process that deduces a true correspondence from a (set of) matches. For SSSOM, this distinction is a bit academic, but useful to keep in mind when talking about the interplay of automated approaches (which result in \"matches\") and manual approaches (which typically result in the final mappings). Ontology alignment is the task of determining corresponding terms shared between two or more ontologies, i.e. mappings. Sometimes \"ontology alignment\" refers to the output of the alignment process. Mapping sets can be \"partial\", i.e. covering only a subset of terms in the subject or object source (ontology, database, etc), \"derived\", i.e. one mapping set can be obtained from one or more others (for example, a XAO to MeSH mapping can be obtained by combining a XAO-Uberon mapping with a Uberon-MeSH mapping), or \"complete\". We refer to a \"complete\" mapping, i.e. the set of all correspondences between two resources (ontologies, databases), as an \"alignment\". The identifier of a term has three parts: a namespace that describes in which database or ontology the identifier is defined, a local identifier that unambiguously identifies an entity within that namespace, and optionally a separator that can be used to separate the namespace from the local identifier to make them easier to process. UBERON:0002101, for example, comprises the namespace \"UBERON\", the separator \":\" and the local identifier \"0002101\". There are various syntaxes for denoting identifiers; the UBERON:0002101 notation is called compact URI (CURIE) syntax, which is used widely across the database and ontology worlds. The problem with this syntax is that UBERON may not be a globally unique prefix, so files making use of such CURIEs must come with a prefix map that ensures that UBERON (in the CURIE syntax referred to as \"prefix\") is globally unique by mapping it to the persistent International Resource Identifier (IRI) prefix http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_. This may not be a major problem for a fairly unique prefix such as \"UBERON\", but it is for prefixes such as \"ICD\", which can refer to many different name spaces, such as ICD9, ICD10, ICD11 and more, all of which correspond to entirely different terminologies. Approaches to mapping . There are many different techniques that can be employed to generate term mappings. Automated matching techniques include ontology matching, entity resolution (the task of determining whether two database records correspond to the same entity), semantic similarity or automated reasoning. Recent approaches based on machine learning and graph embeddings show promise for working with messier inputs. No single tool will perform equally well on all inputs: some of the semantics-aware tools like LogMap and Agreement Maker Light (AML) can exploit the ontology structure to determine high-quality matches but will have problems with the large-scale data linking tasks required by modern big-data applications. Purely automated approaches to mapping are often insufficient for real world use cases that require a high degree of accuracy, such as medical diagnostics. They often need to be refined by hand or using sophisticated mapping reconciliation approaches independent of the actual matching. Determining a mapping is often complex, due to the high degree of terminological variability: different communities may use very different names for the same real world entities . For example, for example, the condition referred to in the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) as \"Hyperchloriduria\" is called \"increased urine chloride ion level\" in the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP), which is used by the model organism community. Mapping rules - capturing the conditions under which a match is established . Mapping rules define the conditions under which we determine a match between two terms. For example, the condition for a mapping rule could be \"if the subject label and object label match exactly\". In practice, mapping rules can be very simple (e.g., \"exact match of term labels\"), more complex (\"exact match between label of subject and exact synonym of object after they are pre-processed using stemming\"), or even more exacting (\"complex match determined by a human curator that carefully reviewed the descriptions and definitions of both terms and concluded they mean the same thing\"). One problem for both manually curated mappings and automated approaches is that these mapping rules are often hidden deeply in the code or are not documented at all. Exposing mapping rules along with confidence scores would be very valuable for reviewing mappings and explaining them to users. Our reference implementation for SSSOM is rdf-matcher, which makes these mapping rules explicit, but other approaches such as OMOP2OBO also capture mapping rules as part of the mapping metadata. Some notes on the standardisation process: Note this is a public copy of the editors\u2019 draft. It is provided for discussion only and may change at any moment. Do not cite this document other than as work in progress. SSSOM is community-driven, so all feedback is welcome. SSSOM Metadata Elements The SSSOM specification defines a set of SSSOM metadata elements that are used to describe mappings. Apart from the elements themselves, some example usage and a description, the SSSOM spec defines the canonical order for the metadata in which the elements should appear when serialised. This precludes spurious diffs in a git setting, which is an important concern for the continuous reviewing of mappings by curators and users. A \"term\" is defined in a controlled vocabulary / ontology, and usually corresponds to a class, an individual or a property (entity in OWL, concept in SKOS, resource in RDF). The \"subject\" is the term on the left side of the mapping, and the \"object\" is the term on the right side of the mapping. A \"predicate\" relates the subject with the object and is typically an annotation or object property. A \"mapping set\" is a set of mappings that can be shared using the SSSOM standard. The conceptual model of SSSOM has two main elements: a Mapping and a MappingSet . Some SSSOM metadata elements apply only to one element or the other, but many can be applied to both. Note that some SSSOM metadata elements have known equivalent properties which will be used in the RDF serialisation, for example see_also is mapped to rdfs:seeAlso . All metadata elements and their mappings are declared and managed in the SSSOM schema . Metadata Elements The latest version of the metadata elements are: Mapping MappingSet Common Mapping Predicates The use of predicates is not restricted by SSSOM, but for maximum re-use, the following predicates are strongly encouraged. Sources: https://www.bioontology.org/wiki/BioPortal_Mappings Predicate Description owl:sameAs The subject and the object are instances (owl individuals), and the two instances are the same. owl:equivalentClass The subject and the object are classes (owl class), and the two classes are the same. owl:equivalentProperty The subject and the object are properties (owl object, data, annotation properties), and the two properties are the same. rdfs:subClassOf The subject and the object are classes (owl class), and the subject is a subclass of the object. rdfs:subPropertyOf The subject and the object are properties (owl object, data, annotation properties), and the subject is a subproperty of the object. skos:relatedMatch The subject and the object are associated in some unspecified way. skos:closeMatch The subject and the object are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. skos:exactMatch The subject and the object can, with a high degree of confidence, be used interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval applications. skos:narrowMatch From the SKOS primer: A triple skos:narrower (and skos:narrowMatch) asserts that , the object of the triple, is a narrower concept than , the subject of the triple. skos:broadMatch From the SKOS primer: A triple skos:broader (and skos:broadMatch) asserts that , the object of the triple, is a broader concept than , the subject of the triple. oio:database_cross_reference Two terms are related in some way. The meaning is frequently consistent across a single set of mappings. Note this property is often overloaded even where the terms are of a different nature (e.g. interpro2go) rdfs:seeAlso The subject and the object are associated in some unspecified way. The object IRI often resolves to a resource on the web that provides additional information. RO:? Any Relation in the Relation Ontology (RO). Serialisation RDF/XML serialised re-ified OWL axioms: The default RDFXML serialisation of the mappings will be realised as reified OWL axioms . This has the advantage that any mapping set can be simply merged with an ontology in the usual way, for example using ROBOT merge . We will deal with three types of reified OWL-axioms, and a few sub-types: Predicate is an annotation property Predicate is an object property and Object/Subject are classes Object/Subject are individuals Predicate is language relational construct of RDFS or OWL (rdfs:subClassOf, owl:equivalentClass) Predicate is an annotation property: If the predicate corresponds to an annotation property, the mapping gets converted to an OWLAnnotationAssertion axiom: OWLAnnotationAssertion(P,S,O) . All mapping level metadata ( sssomMetadata ) gets converted into OWLAnnotation objects which are materialised as axiom annotations on the mapping annotation assertion, see OWL 2 Structural Specification : AnnotationAssertion(sssomMetadata P, S, O) Where sssomMetadata is a sequence of OWL Annotations objects like: Annotation(Q1,V1) Annotation(Q2,V2) ... Annotation(Qn,Vn) where Qi is a SSSOM metadata element and Vi is an annotation value. Note that if a SSSOM metadata element value is a list L (i.e. can have multiple elements, such as creator and others), individual annotations are created for each of them: Annotation(Q,V) for all V in L. Example: AnnotationAssertion(Annotation(sssom:creator_id <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779>) Annotation(sssom:mapping_justification semapv:LexicalEquivalenceMatch) skos:exactMatch <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009894> <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_0000019>) Mapping set level annotations are manifested as Ontology annotation in the usual way, according to the OWL 2 Structural Specification . Predicate is an object property Case 1: Object and Subject are classes. The Mapping gets translated into an existential restriction: SubclassOf(A, P some O) All metadata elements are added as OWLAnnotation objects and added to SubclassOf axiom as axiom annotations: SubclassOf(sssomMetadata, A, P some O) Example: SubClassOf(Annotation(sssom:creator_id <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779>) Annotation(sssom:mapping_justification semapv:LexicalEquivalenceMatch) <http://example.org/AA> ObjectSomeValuesFrom(<http://example.org/x> <http://example.org/BB>)) Case 2: Object and Subject are individuals The Mapping gets translated into an object property assertion: ObjectPropertyAssertion(P, A, O) All metadata elements are added as OWLAnnotation objects and added to ObjectPropertyAssertion axiom as axiom annotations: ObjectPropertyAssertion(sssomMetadata, P, A, O) Example: ObjectPropertyAssertion(Annotation(sssom:creator_id <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779>) Annotation(sssom:mapping_justification semapv:LexicalEquivalenceMatch) <http://www.example.org/x> <http://www.example.org/a> <http://www.example.org/b>) Predicate is language relational construct of RDFS or OWL The mapping gets translated into an annotated axiom that corresponds to the construct used. By default, SSSOM will support: owl:EquivalentClass EquivalentClass(sssomMetadata,A,O) rdfs:subClassOf SubClassOf(sssomMetadata, A,O) Example: SubClassOf(Annotation(sssom:creator_id <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779>) Annotation(sssom:mapping_justification semapv:LexicalEquivalenceMatch) <http://www.example.org/a> <http://www.example.org/b>) TSV: All SSSOM metadata elements labelled with L in the metadata table are permissible as column names in the TSV. List elements (such as creator) are \"|\"-separated. The columns MUST be sorted according to the order as they appear in the SSSOM metadata . For example, the first columns of a mapping set TSV should always be, in that order: subject_id, predicate_id, object_id, mapping_justification, if labels are not included; if they are included, the order should be: subject_id, subject_label, predicate_id, predicate_label, object_id, object_label, mapping_justification. For easier review of diffs, for example git diff or unix diff, we recommend to serialise the TSV by a fixed row order, sorted column by column from left to right. Metadata about a set of mappings can be supplied as part of the mappings (embedded mode) and as a simple yaml file alongside the primary mapping file. Note that for the TSV, it will be required to supply a valid curie map that allows the unambiguous interpretation of CURIEs. A curie map is supplied after a curie_map: parameter in the yaml file. The value can be either a dictionary of CURIE->URLPREFIX pairs or a link to a valid curie map of the same shape. Note that only metadata elements permissible in a global context (G, or L/G) can be used in the metadata-file. We recommend to use the following filename conventions for SSSOM metadatafiles: TSV files should have the extension .sssom.tsv , for example: mp-hp-exact-0.0.1.sssom.tsv . External yaml metadata files should have the extension .sssom.yml , for example mp-hp-exact-0.0.1.sssom.tsv Example ( download ): creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" curie_map: HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" skos: \"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core\" license: \"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" mapping_provider: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno.owl\" External mode In external mode, the mapping set metadata is supplied by a separate YAML file having the same base-name of the mapping file, with the extension -meta.yml . By default, tools will look for the file of that name in the same directory as the the mapping set table. Example ( download ): subject_id predicate_id object_id mapping_justification subject_label object_label HP:0009124 skos:exactMatch MP:0000003 Lexical Abnormal adipose tissue morphology abnormal adipose tissue morphology HP:0008551 skos:exactMatch MP:0000018 Lexical Microtia small ears HP:0000411 skos:exactMatch MP:0000021 Lexical Protruding ear prominent ears Embedded mode (default) In the embedded mode, we allow the integration of mapping set level metadata as commented YAML . Apart from being commented, the YAML follows the exact same spec as the YAML specified by the external mode . Heavily used tools in bioinformatics such as pandas allow to specify comment characters when reading CSV files, which makes this option the most user friendly for this community. Additionally, it is a simple unix-level or language-level operation to filter these as a pre-processing in a robust fashion. Note: the mapping set level metadata must be included as a continuous block at the beginning of the file . This means in particular: - No comments can be included that are not part of the metadata data. For example, this is not allowed: Illegal case 1: #creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" # This is a comment that does not belong here #curie_map: # HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" # MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" Illegal case 2: # This is a comment that does not belong here #creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" #curie_map: # HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" # MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" There should be no empty rows: the commented yaml files must be directly followed by the column headers. For example, this is not allowed: Illegal case 3: #creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" #curie_map: # HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" # MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" The can be only a single # in the beginning of each row, followed immediately by the yaml.

In principle, to reach full integration through mappings, you will have to cross-map all ontologies, or semantic spaces (e.g. controlled vocabularies, semantic databases), which means if you have N \"spaces\", you have N x (N - 1) mappings (because A -> B is often different from B -> A). It makes sense to consider mappings as a directed graph from which you can infer other mappings using graph walking or graph traversals . To mitigate the explosion of mappings, we have to be able to cross-walk. While some typical mapping predicates such as owl:equivalentClass or skos:exactMatch are symetric (which means that if A -> B then you can infer B -> A, which we will call a \"walk-back\"), other are not (skos:narrowMatch), but maybe have inverse predicates (A --[skos:narrowMatch]--> B implies B --[skos:broadMatch]--> A). Apart from walk backs, you can infer additional mappings through a chain of subsequent mappings (multi-hop forward walks), for example: - multi-hop forward walks { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304, ncbiprotein:YP_009725304-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627 } --> {PR:000050277 -> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627} ) - walk-backs { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304 } --> {ncbiprotein:YP_009725304 -> PR:000050277} - combinations { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304, ncbiprotein:YP_009725304-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627, MY:NSP8-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627 } --> { PR:000050277 -> MY:NSP8 } To enable cross-walking, we propose the following Five-Star system for mapping sets. 1-Star mappings fulfill the following criteria: record subject id, object id and mapping precision (exact, broad, narrow, close, related) using qualified names (either URIs or CURIEs + curie maps) for subject id and object id using a standard file format (JSON, XML, CSV, TSV) made available in a public space optional : record the subject and object labels to make it easier for humans to read the file 2-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 1-star mappings and furthermore made available in a public version control system with an issue tracker record the semantic predicate explicitly and using qualified names for the semantic predicate (i.e. owl:equivalentClass, skos:exactMatch) record a confidence value for the mapping between 0 and 1 (0 no confidence, 1 100% confidence). record an open license for the use of the mapping set 3-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 2-star mappings and furthermore are exported in SSSOM format record the following additional metadata: mapping_justification (s) (Lexical, Logical match, HumanCurated etc) date of the mapping creator_id subject_source object_source subject_source_version object_source_version mapping_tool if the mapping was automatically computed using a tool 4-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 3-star mappings and furthermore register the mapping at a mapping commons record the following additional metadata: mapping_set_id mapping_set_description mapping_set_version mapping_provider (if the mapping is not original, i.e. it is not derived from another source) provide a completely executable curation_rule: if the mapping is Lexical , provide: subject_preprocessing , object_preprocessing subject_match_field , object_match_field match_string if the mapping is Logical , the mapping should be derivable by a reasoner from a combination of the object_source and subject_source .

The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) is an initiative to provide a minimal and standard set of elements for the dissemination of mappings between ontology terms, to ensure a reliable interpretation of generated mappings and to enable sharing and data integration between people and applications.

The first, owl:equivalentClass, is a strong logical equivalence assertion which is not appropriate for more nuanced mappings such as close matches. The second, hasDbXref, does not assert formal logical equivalence but also has no clearly defined meaning. Finally, the SKOS vocabulary provides a hierarchy of mapping properties which allow the unambigous specification of exact, close, broad, and narrow matches, but does not provide the means for mappings to be annotated with additional metadata such as confidence scores and provenance. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) addresses these problems by defining a catalog of metadata terms to describe mappings. Both individual mappings and sets of mappings can be described, enabling provenance and metadata to be captured on multiple levels. SSSOM interoperates with existing methods for the specification of mappings, allowing any predicate to be used to describe the nature of each mapping including those from OWL and SKOS. The provenance of mappings - such as whether the mapping was created as the result of a human-curated equivalence match, or a semantic similarity match - is specified using a controlled vocabulary (CV), SSSOM CV. Combined with the metadata properties provided by SSSOM such as confidence and semantic_similarity_score, this provenance information can be used to capture mapping descriptions in a manner that is explicit and amenable to curation. Two serialisations for SSSOM mappings are provided in this document, aimed at different communities: an RDF/OWL serialisation using IRIs that is aimed at the Knowledge Graph/Semantic Web community, and a TSV serialisation using CURIE syntax which is aimed at the wider bioinformatics community. An unambiguous translation between these serialisations is provided.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"spec/#challenges-for-exchange-and-use-of-mappings","text":"Despite their importance for data integration, term mappings are typically neglected as data artefacts (57). A mapping in this context is a correspondence between two terms, referred to here as \"subject\" and \"object\" terms. A \"predicate\" defines the type of relationship between the subject and the object, such as skos:exactMatch, or owl:equivalentClass. A mapping, or \"match\", does not have to be exact: it can be broad, e.g. between a conceptually narrow term such as \"Red Delicious\" and a conceptually broader term such as \"Apple\". To our knowledge, no formal review has been published that analyzes the representation and formats used for collections of term mappings (mapping sets, or alignments), but in our experience, most mapping sets are represented as tables using an ad-hoc \"schema\", often merely a simple two-column format that lists matching terms in two naming schemes. An example of such a table can be seen in the following Table. Subject Object UBERON:0002101 FMA:24875 UBERON:0000019 FMA:54448 Table 1: An example of a typical mapping table one might find on the web. This type of table lacks clear semantics and is therefore very difficult to use and re-use either by humans or by machines. We will discuss a few of the most critical problems in the sections that follow. Non-transparent imprecision . Mapping precision describes, usually qualitatively, whether a mapping between a subject and an object is exact, broad, narrow, close or related. An exact mapping means that the subject term can be replaced with the object term and vice versa, i.e. they refer to the exact same real-world entity. A broad mapping links a subject term to a more general term, for example, the term \"leg\" to the term \"hindlimb\" (if the ontology defines leg as the parts of the hindlimb that exclude the foot). A narrow mapping links a subject term to a more specific term. For example, \"long QT syndrome\" in the Mondo Disease Ontology is a narrow match to \"Romano-Ward long QT syndrome\" in Orphanet. A close mapping relates two terms that are neither exact, broad or narrow, but belong to the same category of things and are semantically similar, such as \"apple\" to \"pear\", or \"paw\" to \"hand\". Due to its subjective nature (\"what is close?\"), this is a problematic category of mapping, but it is widely used, for example for relating similar anatomical terms across species. Related mappings are mappings across categories of things, such as the mapping between a phenotype \"enlarged liver\" and the anatomical entity \"liver\". In practice, it is rare that mapping tables such as the one presented in Table 1 constitute a set of purely \"exact\" matches. Different use cases may require different levels of mapping precision. For example, for entity merging (defined as the process of merging two entities from different sources into one) or data translation (defined as the process of moving annotations from using one ontology to another), exact mappings may be required, while for data grouping broad matches are often sufficient (ensuring that the subject is classified under the object term). For many machine learning use cases, close and related matches will be extremely useful regardless of their lack of semantic precision (though semantic precision is likely to improve predictive power). In practice, many mappings are to varying degrees imprecise but do not specify the mapping precision. This makes it impossible to reliably apply them to use cases such as entity merging or data translation. Non-transparent accuracy, confidence, and provenance . To scale to real-world use cases, automated tools are critical for matching terms across databases, terminologies and ontologies. Such tools typically implement mapping rules that determine whether a given pair of terms constitutes a match. For example, label matching rules might include \"match if subject and object labels match\", \"match if subject label matches with an exact synonym of the object\" and \"match if subject and object exhibit a very high degree of semantic similarity\". Depending on the rules, tools will have more or less confidence that a match constitutes a mapping. Even human curators often have different levels of confidence about the accuracy of any given mapping, especially if the process of determining whether a mapping is accurate involves the review of (often complex) descriptions and term definitions. Different use cases will profit from different degrees of accuracy. For example, if we seek to integrate data from various medical terminologies to inform medical diagnosis, we may require not only a very high degree of confidence about the mapping but also ensure that the mapping is \"explainable\" to users. To ensure that diagnostic decisions that require bridging of data silos through mappings are explainable, we furthermore need provenance (documentation of where a piece of data comes from and how it was produced), such as an explicit statement of the mapping rules by which the match was originally determined (for example, the labels of both terms could have been the same). Thanks to efforts by initiatives such as the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), many mapping tables on the web include at least a confidence score. However, in our experience, mapping rules are rarely stated explicitly as part of the mappings or mapping set metadata. Many mappings in the wild are to varying degrees inaccurate, but without a confidence score and explicit mapping rules, this inaccuracy will not be transparent. Non-transparent incompleteness . Mapping sets can be incomplete for (at least) three major reasons: (1) they are out of date, i.e. a term in one ontology was removed (deprecated) in a later version of the ontology or a term with a more precise mapping was introduced; (2) they are deliberately partial, i.e. covering only a subset of terms, which were mapped for a specific purpose (for example a manual effort to map all COVID-19-relevant phenotypes from the Human Phenotype Ontology to the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology); or (3) they accidentally omit certain correct mappings, as the automated approaches that were used did not detect them (false negatives). We cannot determine whether a mapping set such as the one given in Table X1 is up-to-date, deliberately partial or accidentally incomplete without sufficient metadata about the purpose of the mappings, the tools used and the version of the source data used for the matching process. UnFAIRness . The FAIR principles are a set of community-developed guidelines to ensure that data or any digital object are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Unlike many of the widely used controlled vocabularies, ontologies and data schemas, mappings are rarely published using standard formats and metadata vocabularies and can therefore be considered second class citizens in the world of FAIR semantics. While some tools exist to browse mappings (the F and A in FAIR, findable and accessible), such as OxO and BioPortal, they lack access to at least some of the metadata required to determine their applicability for a use case: Are mappings likely to be correct? Are they precise enough? Have they been updated recently? Can I trust the authority that generated the mappings? While some minimum level of interoperability (the I in FAIR) is achieved simply by publishing the mappings as RDF triples (which rarely happens in practice), most mappings are best captured in the form of simple tables (in our experience the preferred format for both mapping curators and data engineers). Furthermore, the predicates or relations used in the mappings are far from standardized. Different relations have different semantics, ranging from strong logical relations such as owl:sameAs or owl:equivalentClass to predicates with no formally specified semantics such as oboInOwl:hasDbXref. In our experience, reusability (the R in FAIR) is a significant obstacle to FAIRness. It is infeasible to simply reuse existing mappings without the metadata required to make imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness explicit. Repositories such as OxO and BioPortal cannot make mappings more accessible, because the metadata required to do so simply does not exist. In order to gradually improve our mappings and make them FAIRer, we need to be able to share, review, fix and maintain our mappings in much the same way as our ontologies themselves - using standard formats and rich metadata. FAIRifying data is an effort that aims to supply practical solutions for the use of the FAIR guiding principles throughout the research data life cycle. It recommends technologies that support semantic interoperability in a sustainable way, and practices that support FAIRness. The FAIRSemantics effort is currently discussing how to incorporate semantic mappings, and we reached out to them to consider SSSOM for this purpose.","title":"Challenges for exchange and use of mappings"},{"location":"spec/#background-about-mappings","text":"A mapping can be defined as a triple , where s is the subject of the mapping, p is the mapping predicate (or relation) and o is the object. There are many different mapping predicates used in practice, but they are not always standardized. The Semantic Web community uses a number of standard mapping predicates, such as owl:sameAs or owl:equivalentClass (logical mapping predicates) and skos:exactMatch or skos:broadMatch (terminological mapping predicates). We refer to mapping subjects and objects as \"terms\", which we will loosely define here as a set of symbols that define some entity in the real world. Usually, a term can be referred to by an identifier that uniquely identifies some entity in a certain context. For example, UBERON:0002101 is the identifier for a term that refers to the anatomical entity \"limb\". Putting it all together, the mapping describes a correspondence in which the term with the id UBERON:0002101 constitutes a terminological exact match to the term with the identifier FMA:24875. Mappings between data model elements, databases and other representations can be described similarly. Note that we generally use the terms \"matching\" and \"mapping\" interchangeably. Occasionally we refer to \"matching\" as the process to determine a mapping candidate (lexical matching, logical matching etc), a \"match\" as the result of the matching process, and a \"mapping\" the process and result of the process that deduces a true correspondence from a (set of) matches. For SSSOM, this distinction is a bit academic, but useful to keep in mind when talking about the interplay of automated approaches (which result in \"matches\") and manual approaches (which typically result in the final mappings). Ontology alignment is the task of determining corresponding terms shared between two or more ontologies, i.e. mappings. Sometimes \"ontology alignment\" refers to the output of the alignment process. Mapping sets can be \"partial\", i.e. covering only a subset of terms in the subject or object source (ontology, database, etc), \"derived\", i.e. one mapping set can be obtained from one or more others (for example, a XAO to MeSH mapping can be obtained by combining a XAO-Uberon mapping with a Uberon-MeSH mapping), or \"complete\". We refer to a \"complete\" mapping, i.e. the set of all correspondences between two resources (ontologies, databases), as an \"alignment\". The identifier of a term has three parts: a namespace that describes in which database or ontology the identifier is defined, a local identifier that unambiguously identifies an entity within that namespace, and optionally a separator that can be used to separate the namespace from the local identifier to make them easier to process. UBERON:0002101, for example, comprises the namespace \"UBERON\", the separator \":\" and the local identifier \"0002101\". There are various syntaxes for denoting identifiers; the UBERON:0002101 notation is called compact URI (CURIE) syntax, which is used widely across the database and ontology worlds. The problem with this syntax is that UBERON may not be a globally unique prefix, so files making use of such CURIEs must come with a prefix map that ensures that UBERON (in the CURIE syntax referred to as \"prefix\") is globally unique by mapping it to the persistent International Resource Identifier (IRI) prefix http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_. This may not be a major problem for a fairly unique prefix such as \"UBERON\", but it is for prefixes such as \"ICD\", which can refer to many different name spaces, such as ICD9, ICD10, ICD11 and more, all of which correspond to entirely different terminologies. Approaches to mapping . There are many different techniques that can be employed to generate term mappings. Automated matching techniques include ontology matching, entity resolution (the task of determining whether two database records correspond to the same entity), semantic similarity or automated reasoning. Recent approaches based on machine learning and graph embeddings show promise for working with messier inputs. No single tool will perform equally well on all inputs: some of the semantics-aware tools like LogMap and Agreement Maker Light (AML) can exploit the ontology structure to determine high-quality matches but will have problems with the large-scale data linking tasks required by modern big-data applications. Purely automated approaches to mapping are often insufficient for real world use cases that require a high degree of accuracy, such as medical diagnostics. They often need to be refined by hand or using sophisticated mapping reconciliation approaches independent of the actual matching. Determining a mapping is often complex, due to the high degree of terminological variability: different communities may use very different names for the same real world entities . For example, for example, the condition referred to in the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) as \"Hyperchloriduria\" is called \"increased urine chloride ion level\" in the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP), which is used by the model organism community. Mapping rules - capturing the conditions under which a match is established . Mapping rules define the conditions under which we determine a match between two terms. For example, the condition for a mapping rule could be \"if the subject label and object label match exactly\". In practice, mapping rules can be very simple (e.g., \"exact match of term labels\"), more complex (\"exact match between label of subject and exact synonym of object after they are pre-processed using stemming\"), or even more exacting (\"complex match determined by a human curator that carefully reviewed the descriptions and definitions of both terms and concluded they mean the same thing\"). One problem for both manually curated mappings and automated approaches is that these mapping rules are often hidden deeply in the code or are not documented at all. Exposing mapping rules along with confidence scores would be very valuable for reviewing mappings and explaining them to users. Our reference implementation for SSSOM is rdf-matcher, which makes these mapping rules explicit, but other approaches such as OMOP2OBO also capture mapping rules as part of the mapping metadata.","title":"Background about mappings"},{"location":"spec/#some-notes-on-the-standardisation-process","text":"Note this is a public copy of the editors\u2019 draft.

A \"term\" is defined in a controlled vocabulary / ontology, and usually corresponds to a class, an individual or a property (entity in OWL, concept in SKOS, resource in RDF). The \"subject\" is the term on the left side of the mapping, and the \"object\" is the term on the right side of the mapping. A \"predicate\" relates the subject with the object and is typically an annotation or object property. A \"mapping set\" is a set of mappings that can be shared using the SSSOM standard. The conceptual model of SSSOM has two main elements: a Mapping and a MappingSet . Some SSSOM metadata elements apply only to one element or the other, but many can be applied to both.

For example, the first columns of a mapping set TSV should always be, in that order: subject_id, predicate_id, object_id, mapping_justification, if labels are not included; if they are included, the order should be: subject_id, subject_label, predicate_id, predicate_label, object_id, object_label, mapping_justification. For easier review of diffs, for example git diff or unix diff, we recommend to serialise the TSV by a fixed row order, sorted column by column from left to right. Metadata about a set of mappings can be supplied as part of the mappings (embedded mode) and as a simple yaml file alongside the primary mapping file. Note that for the TSV, it will be required to supply a valid curie map that allows the unambiguous interpretation of CURIEs. A curie map is supplied after a curie_map: parameter in the yaml file. The value can be either a dictionary of CURIE->URLPREFIX pairs or a link to a valid curie map of the same shape. Note that only metadata elements permissible in a global context (G, or L/G) can be used in the metadata-file. We recommend to use the following filename conventions for SSSOM metadatafiles: TSV files should have the extension .sssom.tsv , for example: mp-hp-exact-0.0.1.sssom.tsv .

Apart from being commented, the YAML follows the exact same spec as the YAML specified by the external mode . Heavily used tools in bioinformatics such as pandas allow to specify comment characters when reading CSV files, which makes this option the most user friendly for this community. Additionally, it is a simple unix-level or language-level operation to filter these as a pre-processing in a robust fashion. Note: the mapping set level metadata must be included as a continuous block at the beginning of the file . This means in particular: - No comments can be included that are not part of the metadata data.

In principle, to reach full integration through mappings, you will have to cross-map all ontologies, or semantic spaces (e.g. controlled vocabularies, semantic databases), which means if you have N \"spaces\", you have N x (N - 1) mappings (because A -> B is often different from B -> A). It makes sense to consider mappings as a directed graph from which you can infer other mappings using graph walking or graph traversals . To mitigate the explosion of mappings, we have to be able to cross-walk. While some typical mapping predicates such as owl:equivalentClass or skos:exactMatch are symetric (which means that if A -> B then you can infer B -> A, which we will call a \"walk-back\"), other are not (skos:narrowMatch), but maybe have inverse predicates (A --[skos:narrowMatch]--> B implies B --[skos:broadMatch]--> A). Apart from walk backs, you can infer additional mappings through a chain of subsequent mappings (multi-hop forward walks), for example: - multi-hop forward walks { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304, ncbiprotein:YP_009725304-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627 } --> {PR:000050277 -> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627} ) - walk-backs { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304 } --> {ncbiprotein:YP_009725304 -> PR:000050277} - combinations { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304, ncbiprotein:YP_009725304-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627, MY:NSP8-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627 } --> { PR:000050277 -> MY:NSP8 } To enable cross-walking, we propose the following Five-Star system for mapping sets. 1-Star mappings fulfill the following criteria: record subject id, object id and mapping precision (exact, broad, narrow, close, related) using qualified names (either URIs or CURIEs + curie maps) for subject id and object id using a standard file format (JSON, XML, CSV, TSV) made available in a public space optional : record the subject and object labels to make it easier for humans to read the file 2-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 1-star mappings and furthermore made available in a public version control system with an issue tracker record the semantic predicate explicitly and using qualified names for the semantic predicate (i.e. owl:equivalentClass, skos:exactMatch) record a confidence value for the mapping between 0 and 1 (0 no confidence, 1 100% confidence). record an open license for the use of the mapping set 3-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 2-star mappings and furthermore are exported in SSSOM format record the following additional metadata: mapping_justification (s) (Lexical, Logical match, HumanCurated etc) date of the mapping creator_id subject_source object_source subject_source_version object_source_version mapping_tool if the mapping was automatically computed using a tool 4-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 3-star mappings and furthermore register the mapping at a mapping commons record the following additional metadata: mapping_set_id mapping_set_description mapping_set_version mapping_provider (if the mapping is not original, i.e. it is not derived from another source) provide a completely executable curation_rule: if the mapping is Lexical , provide: subject_preprocessing , object_preprocessing subject_match_field , object_match_field match_string if the mapping is Logical , the mapping should be derivable by a reasoner from a combination of the object_source and subject_source .

We do provide a few materials in the Background section below that touch on the above concepts, but a detailed discussion is out of scope. Table of contents Background Ontology alignment What are we mapping? CURIEs, URIs and databases How to create an SSSOM mapping set from scratch Manually curating mapping sets Automated processing 1: Creating an embedded SSSOM file Background As a reminder, a SSSOM mapping comprises three major components: The mapping itself, that is, a triple <subject, predicate, object> that reflects a correspondence of a subject entity, for example a class in an ontology, to an object entity, for example an identifier in some database, via a semantic mapping predicate , such as skos:exactMatch . A mapping justification , the process or activity that led us to consider the mapping to be correct or reasonable (typical examples: labels match exactly; two classes are logically equivalent; a domain expert determined that two terms reflect the same real world concept). Provenance metadata , including information about author and mapping_tool . In the following, we will give pointers to some useful background materials before we describe how SSSOM mappings are created. Ontology alignment/matching Ontology alignment is the process of determining correspondences between ontological concepts. The usage of \"alignment\", \"matching\" and \"mapping\" is fuzzy in practice. From the perspective of SSSOM, alignment usually involves determining all (or a more or less complete set of) correspondences between ontological concepts of two or more source ontologies. The most important resource on the subject is \"Ontology Matching\" by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Euzenat and Pavel Shvaiko. If you are interested in really diving into the subject, there is no avoiding this book! This 25 minute course unit by the OpenHPI gives a nice overview over the area, which is relevant to all mapping activities: Another useful overview is this one by the Knowledge and Data VU Amsterdam. Especially after minute 12, we learn a bit about the differences of OWL and SKOS. A 10 minute deep-dive into Jerome Euzenat classification of ontology matching techniques can be seen here: A 10 minute overview of Clinical Terminology Mappings by Michael Kahn at CU Anschutz can be seen in the following. This video is highly optional and reveals a very non-semantic webby perspective on the subject. It is focussed on OMOP mappings, one of the many terminology standards in the medical domain. What are we mapping? In SSSOM we are concerned with mapping information entities , i.e. representations of a real world entities. Examples of such entities are: Classes, Individuals and Properties in an ontology. Entities in Databases, such as a specific person in a \"Person\" table of a relational database. A specific value in the slot of a data model, for example the \"UNIVERSITY\" constant in the highest-degree enumeration for a demographics survey data model. A specific code from a code system or terminology such as ICD10CM. Information entities represent real world objects such as diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's, Diabetes), kinds of vegetables (Asparagus, Broccoli), concrete instances of vegetables (a specific broccoli that was sold in your local supermarket yesterday). What kind of entities can we not map with SSSOM? Some of the limitations of SSSOM are discussed in our paper . A selection of the most important things that cannot be mapped at the moment: Compound/complex entities, i.e. entities that are defined by more than one term. For example, we cannot currently map \"Raw apple\" (subject) to \"Apple\" and \"Raw\" (two objects). Anything that is not an entity, e.g. unit conversion rules (1000mg maps to 1g * 1000) or functions. Highly contextual entities like \"PERSON:1\" as they enter the hospital. As a rule of thumb, we can map any entity for which (1) we can provide a single identifier and (2) whose identifier establishes its context (i.e. no further information is needed to understand the meaning of the identifier). Note that literal values are a special case - SSSOM is not designed for mapping literals to entity identifiers, but there are some discussions on how to do this anyways here . CURIEs, URIs and databases A mapping involves three entities: A subject (the entity which is mapped to some other entity) An object (the entity the subject is mapped to) A semantic mapping predicate , such as \"skos:exactMatch\" which defines how the subject entity is mapped to the object entity. All three must be referred to by an identifier in CURIE syntax ( Compact URI ) when using the SSSOM table format or JSON, or an IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) when you are using the RDF representation of SSSOM. This is necessary to ensure that entities are globally unique and mapping sets are fully interoperable across an organisation and beyond. While these concepts are common practice in the Semantic Web world, they may be less well understood in the database world. In fact, they can be quite awkward: - Your database my use p9787869 to identify a specific person in a \"Person\" table of a relational database. - Your data model for a demographics survey uses, among others, the UNIVERSITY constant in the highest-degree enumeration. To be compliant with SSSOM, such values must be \"curified\". While this process sounds daunting at first, it is essential: Both the p9787869 identifier and the UNIVERSITY constant may be used in different contexts (different databases or data models) to refer to entirely different entities! While there is no 100% reliable guide for \"curification\", we usually recommend the following steps: Choose a globally unique URI prefix which can unambiguously define the context of your entity. For example (1) http://embl.org/ebi/person/p9787869 to refer to the person in your Person table and (2) http://embl.org/demographics-survey-datamodel/demographics.highest_education#UNIVERSITY . In an ideal world, these can be de-referenced (i.e. you can look them up in a web-browser), but the important thing is that they are globally unique (and persistent), so that they cannot be confused with, for example, the UNIVERSITY code in another data model. We select a reasonable prefix for the code, for example (1) embl.ebi.person and (2) demographics-survey-datamodel.demographics.highest_education . Note these do not need to be globally unique anymore. Indeed, you could, if you wanted to, use (much) shorter prefixes. (NOTE: some people disagree with this and strive for globally unique prefixes. In the biomedical domain, for example, we try to coordinate prefixes at http://bioregistry.io/. This is not however, necessary when using SSSOM). We record the prefixes and their URI prefixes (sometimes called URI expansions) in the curie_map of our SSSOM file: curie_map: embl.ebi.person: \"http://embl.org/ebi/person/\" demographics-survey-datamodel.demographics.highest_education: \"http://embl.org/demographics-survey-datamodel/demographics.highest_education#\" Now we can refer to our entities in the SSSOM mapping table like this: (1) embl.ebi.person:p9787869 and (2) demographics-survey-datamodel.demographics.highest_education:UNIVERSITY . This may strike some users as verbose - but the concept of unique identifiers for all information entities is at the heart of SSSOM . There is an initial cost to carefully defining namespaces for the various vocabularies and contexts (data model enums, value sets), but the ability to unambiguously refer to an entity will pay of as the organisation grows and data needs to be integrated from a wide variety of sources. Tangent: See here for an example how FHIR , a standard for health care data exchange, published by HL7, deals with this: Rather than using a lot of prefixes, FHIR chooses to have one small namespace for fhir , and then having the path to the data model element all the way to its value as the local identifier. How to create an SSSOM mapping set from scratch SSSOM mapping sets can be created as part of automated processes, like ontology matchers, or manually by ontology curators. While there is overlap, it makes sense to look at both cases separately. To remind yourself why you should build SSSOM mapping sets in the first place, please refer to the FAQ . Manually curating mapping sets To gradually improve terminological mapping practices we are proposing a 5-star system for mappings . For the sake of this tutorial, we will focus on producing a solid 3-Star mapping set with the following metadata: Core mapping metadata : subject_id : The ID of the subject of the mapping predicate_id : The ID of the predicate of the mapping object_id : The ID of the object of the mapping Mapping justification metadata : mapping_justification : the process or activity that led us to believe the mapping to be correct or reasonable. Basic provenance metadata : mapping_date : The date the mapping was asserted. This is different from the date the mapping was published or compiled in a SSSOM file. author_id : Identifies the persons or groups responsible for asserting the mappings. Recommended to be a (pipe-separated) list of ORCIDs or otherwise identifying URLs, but any identifying string (such as name and affiliation) is permissible. mapping_set_description : A description of the mapping set, providing context and motivation. license : An identifier for a license description. mapping_set_id : A unique identifier of the mapping set. mapping_set_version : The version of a mapping set. subject_source : URI of source the subject. subject_source_version : The version of the source of the subject. object_source : URI of source the subject. object_source_version : The version of the source of the object. confidence : the level of certainty you have for the mapping to be true (based on the process used to confirm or generate it). Some convenience metadata subject_label : The human readable label of the subject. object_label : The human readable label of the object. The tutorial scenario You are charged with aligning your organisations (KEWL FOODIE INC) internal database about food and nutrition with Food Ontology (FOODON) . In your database, you have a table with food items: ID LABEL F001 apple F002 gala F003 pink F004 braeburn As a first pass, you are tasked to map the food items (kinds of apples) in your database to classes in the FOODON ontology. Getting the tools together To complete this tutorial, we need the following tools: A table editor. In this tutorial we will use Google Sheets . Manually curating mappings is often done in a collaborative fashion. We like Google Sheets because it allows multiple people to edit the same mapping set at once. OPTIONAL: The SSSOM toolkit installed (requires python 3.9+). Creating a first draft of the mappings First create a google sheet with the following columns: subject_id subject_label predicate_id object_id object_label mapping_justification mapping_date author_id subject_source subject_source_version object_source object_source_version confidence As we are mapping database identifiers, our first step is curiefy our database identifiers . Read up in detail on why this is done here . We chose to use the following URI prefix for our food database: http://kewl-foodie.com/foods/, with the KF_FOODS: prefix (for now, we just document this information in the side, but later, we will add this to our mapping table). Next, we will add all the entities we hope to align to the mapping table above (we removed some columns here for readability, we will get back to these later): subject_id subject_label predicate_id object_id object_label confidence KF_FOOD:F001 apple KF_FOOD:F002 gala KF_FOOD:F003 pink KF_FOOD:F004 braeburn While not necessary from a computational perspective, we recommend to document the labels of both the subject and the object to make the mapping table easier to process for human curators. The next step is now to try and identify suitable terms from FOODON to map to. In the biomedical domain, most curators will search OLS or Ontobee , but some more technically advanced users may choose to use SPARQL over ontobee or another endpoint: PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> SELECT * WHERE { ?sub rdfs:label ?obj . FILTER(regex(str(?obj), \"apple\")) FILTER(STRSTARTS(str(?sub),\"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_\")) } A detailed discussion on mapping predicates can be found here . Mapping \"apple\", attempt 1 Our first attempt is to try and map KF_FOOD:F001 (apple). At the time of writing, a search for the string \"apple\" just across the labels in FOODON reveals more than 300 results. There are no exact matches for the search string \"apple\", i.e. there is no entity in FOODON that has the label \"apple\" exactly. Rather than sifting through the large set of results, we move on to try to map a more specific element first. As FOODON is an ontology, having a mapping to a more specific element (e.g. gala ) may help us to find an appropriate mapping for the more general concept (e.g. apple ), which should be hierarchically related to the more specific term. Mapping \"gala\" Indeed, a search for \"gala\" reveals one single result: Gala apple (whole) . How do we know if this is a good mapping for our own database entity gala ? This is a very difficult question, and there is no perfect answer. It is important to remember that mappings should not be judged in terms of \"correct\" or \"wrong\", but in terms of \"fit for purpose\", or, in the case of SSSOM, \"fit for most purposes\". The following thoughts should cross the curators mind: There does not seem to be another FOODON class concerned with \"Gala\". From the description, \"A pome fruit of a Gala apple tree cultivar.\" it seems like we are indeed talking about a kind of apple. ( The picture in the OLS Term information box also helps. ) A quick email to our product team at KEWL FOODIE INC confirms that indeed, our gala database entity and FOODON's Gala apple (whole) class seem to refer to the same entity. As apples in our database are usually considered \"whole\", we do not concern ourselves further with the that slightly ambiguous part of the label. (Can I map my apple snack pack which has the \"whole\" apple cut in slices to FOODON:00003348 ?) We add the new mapping to our mapping table. Due to our domain expertise and consultation with the product team of our company, we are very confident (1.0 or 100%) that the mapping between KF_FOOD:F002 and FOODON:00003348 is exact (for exact matches, we use skos:exactMatch as per SSSOM convention ). subject_id subject_label predicate_id object_id object_label confidence KF_FOOD:F001 apple KF_FOOD:F002 gala skos:exactMatch FOODON:00003348 Gala apple (whole) 1 KF_FOOD:F003 pink KF_FOOD:F004 braeburn Mapping \"apple\", attempt 2 Given our mapping of Gala apple (whole) we take a better look at the class hierarchy around. We notice three things: There is indeed a class called \"apple (whole)\" which seems to fit our purpose. This also seems to be consistent with our choice of \"Gala apple (whole)\". What is, however, annoying is that there is also a \"apple (whole or parts)\" class. KEWL FOODS INC definitely has plans to introduce products involving sliced Gala apples! FOODON does not have a concept of a sliced Gala apple. Again, our judgement as curators is asked here. There is no \"correct\" or \"wrong\". To keep things consistent, we decide to map to the \"whole\" apple, but we take a mental note that this might change in the future. We also take a physical note to document this design decision as a comment. subject_id subject_label predicate_id object_id object_label confidence comment KF_FOOD:F001 apple skos:exactMatch FOODON:00002473 apple (whole) 0.95 We could map to FOODON:03310788 instead to cover sliced apples, but only \"whole\" apple types exist. KF_FOOD:F002 gala skos:exactMatch FOODON:00003348 Gala apple (whole) 1 KF_FOOD:F003 pink KF_FOOD:F004 braeburn Mapping \"pink\" In the same hierarchy as apple (whole) , we find Pink apple (whole) . This is seems like an excellent match, consistent with our previous design decisions. However two observations leave us uncertain: The Pink apple (whole) class has no definition (at the time of writing this tutorial at least) and no pictures, so we cannot be 100% certain that our notion of \"pink\" is the same as Foodon. A search on Wikipedia reveals different names, like \"Pink Pearl\" and \"Pink Lady\", which makes us a bit uncertain. In contrast to \"Gala apple (whole)\", \"Pink apple (whole)\" has a further subclass, \"Pink apple (whole, raw)\". What does that mean? All data in our KEWL FOODS INC database pertains to raw apple, so is this now a better match? Raw as opposed to what? Cooked? Again, there is no great recipe to solve this dilemma. We chose our default recipe: prefer consistent mapping rules over occasionally increased precision (not always a good idea) document design decision subject_id subject_label predicate_id object_id object_label confidence comment KF_FOOD:F001 apple skos:exactMatch FOODON:00002473 apple (whole) 0.95 We could map to FOODON:03310788 instead to cover sliced apples, but only \"whole\" apple types exist. KF_FOOD:F002 gala skos:exactMatch FOODON:00003348 Gala apple (whole) 1 KF_FOOD:F003 pink skos:exactMatch FOODON:00004186 Pink apple (whole) 0.9 We could map to FOODON:00004187 instead which more specifically refers to \"raw\" Pink apples. Decided against to be consistent with other mapping choices. KF_FOOD:F004 braeburn Mapping \"braeburn\" We now turn our attention to the last database entity: KF_FOOD:F004 (braeburn). Unfortunately, our search for braeburn , brae-burn yields no results in Foodon. We search Wikipedia and Google for potential synonyms of Braeburn that might have been missed by the FOODON developers, but are unsuccessful. In the end, we give up and decide that there is no matching concept for KF_FOOD:F004 (braeburn) in FOODON. Now we have to make a choice and how to reflect that in our mapping set: We can document directly the fact that there is no skos:exactMatch in our SSSOM table. We can map KF_FOOD:F004 (braeburn) to a more general concept, i.e. apple (whole) . We can do both. For our data integration efforts, it is generally useful to know if no exact match could be found. Here, again, we have two options: we can convey this information by omission. By not including a mapping in the dataset, it does not exist. The downside is that we do not know further down the line if (a) we have looked and there really was no suitable code and (b) we have not looked. we can convey this information by using a special code sssom:NoMapping . (NOTE as of 2 May 2022, the final decision on how this is represented has not been made. Follow this discussion ). In our case, we have plans to extend our manual mapping efforts with automated ones. We want to use manual non-mapping assertions to filter out false positive mappings with our automated approaches, so we decide to go with the second option and make the non-mapping explicit. The second question is whether to include a less precise mapping. This depends heavily on the target use case. As a rule of thumb, if the target use case requires precise 1:1 mappings (for example, data transformation use cases often do), we do not include any broad mappings. If our use case is data aggregation, broad matches can still be very useful: At least, we will be able to use the hierarchical structure of FOODON to retrieve all kinds of apples in our FOOD database! We are interested in data aggregation, so we decide to include the mapping. subject_id subject_label predicate_id object_id object_label confidence comment KF_FOOD:F001 apple skos:exactMatch FOODON:00002473 apple (whole) 0.95 We could map to FOODON:03310788 instead to cover sliced apples, but only \"whole\" apple types exist. KF_FOOD:F002 gala skos:exactMatch FOODON:00003348 Gala apple (whole) 1 KF_FOOD:F003 pink skos:exactMatch FOODON:00004186 Pink apple (whole) 0.9 We could map to FOODON:00004187 instead which more specifically refers to \"raw\" Pink apples. Decided against to be consistent with other mapping choices. KF_FOOD:F004 braeburn skos:exactMatch sssom:NoMapping 1 KF_FOOD:F004 braeburn skos:broadMatch FOODON:00002473 apple (whole) 1 Adding rich metadata We are done curating the basic mappings. Next, we will add some richer metadata for the mapping set. For this tutorial we will add the metadata introduce here . Mapping justification metadata : mapping_justification : the process or activity that led us to believe the mapping to be correct or reasonable. This is the most important piece of metadata and a pivotal concept for SSSOM curation in general. Let us think about all the various ways that can lead us to believe a mapping to be correct. The most crude thing would be to document is: \"a Human determined this mapping\". We do that by documenting the mapping justification sempav:HumanCuration . This justification is a vague placeholder, but it instills some confidence in the mapping consumer (the user) that someone with at least some domain expertise determined the mapping to be ok. We will discuss mapping_justification s in more detailed in a later tutorial on automated matching, where we have many more fine-grained distinctions, like \"the justification for asserting this mapping is that the label of the subject matches to an exact synonym of the object after applying 'stemming' during preprocessing\". Nevertheless, modelling human curation better is one of the future goals of SSSOM. The key is to document \"curation rules\", which contain the conditions and assumptions made by the (human) mapping author when asserting the mapping. In the absence of a formal element (at least at the time of this writing, May 2022), you should try and document such curation rules in the comment field. Basic provenance metadata : mapping_date : The date the mapping was asserted. Why is this important? Time of an assertion is essential provenance. It allows us to prefer assertions (mapping decisions) that were done later, but it also gives us a hint how old a mapping is, in particular if the source versions are not, or cannot, be documented. It is a very easy element to document, and we should try to do that at all times. author_id : Identifies the persons or groups responsible for asserting the mappings. The author is a crucial bit of metadata, in particular in conjunction with the mapping justification human curation . A mapping consumer can look up the author of a mapping through their unique identifier (e.g. an ORCiD , which we use in the biomedical domain, but might be anything, including a unique database identifier). Again, we prefer PURLs here, that resolve to some useful information when you look them up. mapping_set_id : A unique identifier of the mapping set. This is a pivotal concept in FAIR data and data management in general: every unit of data that is shared around within an organisation (or the whole world) should have a unique identifier . As per Semantic Web conventions, we recommend using persistent URLs, or PURLs, to identify your mappings set. For example: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.owl is a unique identifier to an ontology and http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/mapping/mondo.sssom.tsv refers to the \"Mondo disease mappings\". mapping_set_version : The version of a mapping set. Versioning is absolutely crucial for mapping sets, much the same way as it is for ontologies. We recommend to use semantic versioning or simple ISO Date versioning, like \"2022-05-01\". The latter is recommended by some organisations like the OBO foundry (it is easier to see how new a mapping set is, and it is easier to sort as a string), but semantic versioning is much more widely used. We use date based versioning in the tutorial. mapping_set_description : A description of the mapping set, providing context and motivation. This is another underrated piece of metadata that allows humans to understand and build trust towards a mapping set. A good description of a mapping set describes the scope and content of a mapping set describes the purpose for the creation of the mapping set is reasonably short, but not too short (3-4 sentences) license : An identifier for a license description. One of the most serious impediments to re-use on the web is the absence of clear and standardised licenses. We recommend the creative commons licenses for open data, either CC-0 (public domain, no license) or CC-BY 4.0. (Some people prefer CC-BY 4.0, because it ensures that attribution is taken more seriously.) Even when using a proprietary license, it is good to be transparent here, so that an \"accidentally leaked\" data file is not mistakenly assumed to be \"open\". subject_source : URI of source the subject. This is one of the most important pieces of metadata: an unambiguous reference to a source. It is notoriously hard to standardise source references ( see past debate ). We recommend to use the standard URIs used in your own domain, for example OBO ( obo:mondo ) or Wikidata ( wikidata:Q7876491 ). subject_source_version : The version of the source of the subject. In order to interpret a mapping, it is not enough to know the source. Sources changes all the time, whether they are database and/or ontology: classes are obsoleted, database records are deleted. What counts for an exact mapping may change through the evolution of a source. Always document the source version, if you can. This can be very difficult for database systems that do not have a real notion of versioning. object_source : URI of source the object. See subject_source . object_source_version : The version of the source of the object. See subject_source_version . Mapping vs Mapping set metadata - where should it go? SSSOM distinguishes between mapping and mapping_set metadata, i.e. metadata that pertains to each individual mapping and metadata that pertains to the whole mapping set. To understand which is which, you can browse the specification . Mapping metadata is usually captured in the rows of the SSSOM mapping table. We have done this a lot so far during this tutorial: documenting our confidence in our mapping decision, and specifying the source of our subject id. However, in SSSOM we have the option to document some mapping metadata on the level of the mapping_set , which means that the metadata item applies to all mappings in the mapping set . We will capture subject and object_source this way, see a bit further below. We capture mapping level metadata in the usual way using our table: subject_id subject_label predicate_id object_id object_label confidence comment mapping_justification mapping_date author_id subject_source_version object_source_version KF_FOOD:F001 apple skos:exactMatch FOODON:00002473 apple (whole) 0.95 We could map to FOODON:03310788 instead to cover sliced apples, but only \"whole\" apple types exist. sempav:HumanCuration 2022-05-02 orcid:0000-0002-7356-1779 http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/foodon/releases/2022-02-01/foodon.owl KF_FOOD:F002 gala skos:exactMatch FOODON:00003348 Gala apple (whole) 1 sempav:HumanCuration 2022-05-02 orcid:0000-0002-7356-1779 http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/foodon/releases/2022-02-01/foodon.owl KF_FOOD:F003 pink skos:exactMatch FOODON:00004186 Pink apple (whole) 0.9 We could map to FOODON:00004187 instead which more specifically refers to \"raw\" Pink apples.

In this tutorial, only mapping_set_id , mapping_set_version , license and mapping_set_description are purely mapping_set metadata. Everything else is considered mapping metadata. Mapping set metadata is captured in YAML format. For this tutorial, we will capture the following: mapping_set_id: https://w3id.org/sssom/tutorial/example1.sssom.tsv license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ mapping_set_version: \"2022-06-01\" mapping_set_description: \"Manually curated alignment of KEWL FOODIE INC internal food and nutrition database with Food Ontology (FOODON). Intended to be used for ontological analysis and grouping of KEWL FOODIE INC related data.\" object_source: wikidata:Q55118395 subject_source: KF_FOOD:DB curie_map: KF_FOOD: https://kewl-foodie.inc/food/ wikidata: http://www.wikidata.org/entity/ FOODON: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_ sempav: https://w3id.org/semapv/ skos: \"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\" sssom: https://w3id.org/sssom/ Despite object_source and subject_source being mapping metadata, we decided to capture them at mapping set level, as they are not likely to change throughout versions of the mapping set. Note that while the object_source resolves to an actual page on the web ( FOODON ), KF_FOOD:DB does not. SSSOM requires a source to correspond to an IRI (see ongoing debate ). This helps to ensure that it is unambiguously clear what the source was. Imagine someone documenting the string INTERNAL_DB or just DB - even in large organisations, but certainly on the web, this can cause clashes. The curie_map (better known as \"prefix map\") is another key concept in SSSOM (and most Semantic Web standards). It maps prefixes to URI expansions. This serves three main purposes. Unambiguously identify the namespace of a prefix. The prefix FOODON: , all by itself, can be used by many different sources. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_ uniquely identifies the namespace of FOODON . This is important when merging different mapping sets together. Expanding and resolving identifiers. Some identifier schemes like the one in the OBO Foundry, Wikidata and many others, resolve identifiers to a page on the web. This allows people (and sometimes machines) to look up additional information about an entity on the web. For example, when we expand FOODON:00002473 to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_00002473, we can look this URI up in a browser. Providing a recipe for creating RDF resources from CURIEs. RDF requires an entity to be represented by a full URI, e.g. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_00002473 . In this case, you can think of the curie_map in essence as a set of RDF prefix declarations . This is only important if your use case requires serialisation into RDF. This concludes the manual curation tutorial. Next, we will process the two mapping sets using \"SSSOM python toolkit\" (aka sssom-py). Automated processing 1: Creating an embedded SSSOM file Important note May 8 2022 *: The SSSOM toolkit have not yet been updated to the most recent changes of the SSSOM data model. If you get an error ValueError: match_type must be supplied , you have to change your SSSOM table to follow this part of the tutorial: Rename the mapping_justification column to match_type . Change the semapv:HumanCuration value in that column to just HumanCurated (sic, without semapv). Embedded vs external mode for SSSOM metadata One problem with table formats like TSV or CSV, in contrast to more flexible tree shaped formats like JSON or XML, is that it is notoriously hard to include metadata about the whole table (for example, mapping set metadata) in them. There are essentially three options: All metadata is stored as values in columns. While this is definitely possible, it is not ideal for a few reasons: It is highly redundant. If we have to store the mapping_set_id , for example, as a value in a mapping table with 1000 mappings, it is repeated 1000 times. It is less immediately clear whether a piece of metadata pertains to the mapping_set or a mapping (you have to study the specification to understand that author_id pertains to an individual mapping rather than the whole mapping set). Metadata about the mapping set is stored within the TSV file header. Basically, we introduce a number of rows at the top of the TSV file that we reserve for metadata. The disadvantage is that many parsers for such flat files do not know how to deal with a header like this. We keep metadata about tables and mapping sets separate, i.e. we keep one TSV file that contains the data and one YAML file that contains the mapping set metadata. This is often a good option, but keeping the two separate may cause a problem: in environments where the data is shared around (emailed, copied) the connection can get lost. In SSSOM, we opted for option 2 as the default, which we call \"embedded mode\" (the metadata is embedded). Most commands in the SSSOM toolkit expect SSSOM files to be in embedded mode. However, we support option 3 (external mode) indirectly by providing operations to simply merge the two before other processing steps. Converting an SSSOM file from from external to embedded mode If you do not have the SSSOM toolkit installed, do so now . Download the food mappings created before. If you feel confident with your own mappings, feel free to use these instead. Mappings Metadata Now you let's use SSSOM toolkit to merge these two: sssom parse example1.sssom.tsv -m example1.sssom.yml -o foodieinc-food.sssom.tsv If you open foodieinc-food.sssom.tsv , you will see: # comment: We could map to FOODON:00004187 instead which more specifically refers to # \"raw\" Pink apples.

One key concern for data management, and mapping management in particular, is to be able under understand the evolution of mappings over time.

The usage of \"alignment\", \"matching\" and \"mapping\" is fuzzy in practice.

The most important resource on the subject is \"Ontology Matching\" by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Euzenat and Pavel Shvaiko. If you are interested in really diving into the subject, there is no avoiding this book! This 25 minute course unit by the OpenHPI gives a nice overview over the area, which is relevant to all mapping activities: Another useful overview is this one by the Knowledge and Data VU Amsterdam.

Examples of such entities are: Classes, Individuals and Properties in an ontology. Entities in Databases, such as a specific person in a \"Person\" table of a relational database. A specific value in the slot of a data model, for example the \"UNIVERSITY\" constant in the highest-degree enumeration for a demographics survey data model. A specific code from a code system or terminology such as ICD10CM. Information entities represent real world objects such as diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's, Diabetes), kinds of vegetables (Asparagus, Broccoli), concrete instances of vegetables (a specific broccoli that was sold in your local supermarket yesterday).","title":"What are we mapping?"},{"location":"tutorial/#what-kind-of-entities-can-we-not-map-with-sssom","text":"Some of the limitations of SSSOM are discussed in our paper . A selection of the most important things that cannot be mapped at the moment: Compound/complex entities, i.e. entities that are defined by more than one term. For example, we cannot currently map \"Raw apple\" (subject) to \"Apple\" and \"Raw\" (two objects). Anything that is not an entity, e.g. unit conversion rules (1000mg maps to 1g * 1000) or functions. Highly contextual entities like \"PERSON:1\" as they enter the hospital. As a rule of thumb, we can map any entity for which (1) we can provide a single identifier and (2) whose identifier establishes its context (i.e. no further information is needed to understand the meaning of the identifier). Note that literal values are a special case - SSSOM is not designed for mapping literals to entity identifiers, but there are some discussions on how to do this anyways here .","title":"What kind of entities can we not map with SSSOM?"},{"location":"tutorial/#curies-uris-and-databases","text":"A mapping involves three entities: A subject (the entity which is mapped to some other entity) An object (the entity the subject is mapped to) A semantic mapping predicate , such as \"skos:exactMatch\" which defines how the subject entity is mapped to the object entity. All three must be referred to by an identifier in CURIE syntax ( Compact URI ) when using the SSSOM table format or JSON, or an IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) when you are using the RDF representation of SSSOM. This is necessary to ensure that entities are globally unique and mapping sets are fully interoperable across an organisation and beyond. While these concepts are common practice in the Semantic Web world, they may be less well understood in the database world. In fact, they can be quite awkward: - Your database my use p9787869 to identify a specific person in a \"Person\" table of a relational database. - Your data model for a demographics survey uses, among others, the UNIVERSITY constant in the highest-degree enumeration. To be compliant with SSSOM, such values must be \"curified\". While this process sounds daunting at first, it is essential: Both the p9787869 identifier and the UNIVERSITY constant may be used in different contexts (different databases or data models) to refer to entirely different entities! While there is no 100% reliable guide for \"curification\", we usually recommend the following steps: Choose a globally unique URI prefix which can unambiguously define the context of your entity. For example (1) http://embl.org/ebi/person/p9787869 to refer to the person in your Person table and (2) http://embl.org/demographics-survey-datamodel/demographics.highest_education#UNIVERSITY . In an ideal world, these can be de-referenced (i.e. you can look them up in a web-browser), but the important thing is that they are globally unique (and persistent), so that they cannot be confused with, for example, the UNIVERSITY code in another data model. We select a reasonable prefix for the code, for example (1) embl.ebi.person and (2) demographics-survey-datamodel.demographics.highest_education . Note these do not need to be globally unique anymore. Indeed, you could, if you wanted to, use (much) shorter prefixes. (NOTE: some people disagree with this and strive for globally unique prefixes. In the biomedical domain, for example, we try to coordinate prefixes at http://bioregistry.io/. This is not however, necessary when using SSSOM). We record the prefixes and their URI prefixes (sometimes called URI expansions) in the curie_map of our SSSOM file: curie_map: embl.ebi.person: \"http://embl.org/ebi/person/\" demographics-survey-datamodel.demographics.highest_education: \"http://embl.org/demographics-survey-datamodel/demographics.highest_education#\" Now we can refer to our entities in the SSSOM mapping table like this: (1) embl.ebi.person:p9787869 and (2) demographics-survey-datamodel.demographics.highest_education:UNIVERSITY . This may strike some users as verbose - but the concept of unique identifiers for all information entities is at the heart of SSSOM . There is an initial cost to carefully defining namespaces for the various vocabularies and contexts (data model enums, value sets), but the ability to unambiguously refer to an entity will pay of as the organisation grows and data needs to be integrated from a wide variety of sources. Tangent: See here for an example how FHIR , a standard for health care data exchange, published by HL7, deals with this: Rather than using a lot of prefixes, FHIR chooses to have one small namespace for fhir , and then having the path to the data model element all the way to its value as the local identifier.","title":"CURIEs, URIs and databases"},{"location":"tutorial/#how-to-create-an-sssom-mapping-set-from-scratch","text":"SSSOM mapping sets can be created as part of automated processes, like ontology matchers, or manually by ontology curators.

Rather than sifting through the large set of results, we move on to try to map a more specific element first.

The following thoughts should cross the curators mind: There does not seem to be another FOODON class concerned with \"Gala\". From the description, \"A pome fruit of a Gala apple tree cultivar.\" it seems like we are indeed talking about a kind of apple. ( The picture in the OLS Term information box also helps. ) A quick email to our product team at KEWL FOODIE INC confirms that indeed, our gala database entity and FOODON's Gala apple (whole) class seem to refer to the same entity. As apples in our database are usually considered \"whole\", we do not concern ourselves further with the that slightly ambiguous part of the label. (Can I map my apple snack pack which has the \"whole\" apple cut in slices to FOODON:00003348 ?) We add the new mapping to our mapping table. Due to our domain expertise and consultation with the product team of our company, we are very confident (1.0 or 100%) that the mapping between KF_FOOD:F002 and FOODON:00003348 is exact (for exact matches, we use skos:exactMatch as per SSSOM convention ). subject_id subject_label predicate_id object_id object_label confidence KF_FOOD:F001 apple KF_FOOD:F002 gala skos:exactMatch FOODON:00003348 Gala apple (whole) 1 KF_FOOD:F003 pink KF_FOOD:F004 braeburn","title":"Mapping \"gala\""},{"location":"tutorial/#mapping-apple-attempt-2","text":"Given our mapping of Gala apple (whole) we take a better look at the class hierarchy around.

What is, however, annoying is that there is also a \"apple (whole or parts)\" class. KEWL FOODS INC definitely has plans to introduce products involving sliced Gala apples!

In the end, we give up and decide that there is no matching concept for KF_FOOD:F004 (braeburn) in FOODON.

We can map KF_FOOD:F004 (braeburn) to a more general concept, i.e. apple (whole) . We can do both. For our data integration efforts, it is generally useful to know if no exact match could be found.

The downside is that we do not know further down the line if (a) we have looked and there really was no suitable code and (b) we have not looked. we can convey this information by using a special code sssom:NoMapping .

We want to use manual non-mapping assertions to filter out false positive mappings with our automated approaches, so we decide to go with the second option and make the non-mapping explicit. The second question is whether to include a less precise mapping. This depends heavily on the target use case. As a rule of thumb, if the target use case requires precise 1:1 mappings (for example, data transformation use cases often do), we do not include any broad mappings.

Mapping justification metadata : mapping_justification : the process or activity that led us to believe the mapping to be correct or reasonable. This is the most important piece of metadata and a pivotal concept for SSSOM curation in general. Let us think about all the various ways that can lead us to believe a mapping to be correct. The most crude thing would be to document is: \"a Human determined this mapping\". We do that by documenting the mapping justification sempav:HumanCuration . This justification is a vague placeholder, but it instills some confidence in the mapping consumer (the user) that someone with at least some domain expertise determined the mapping to be ok. We will discuss mapping_justification s in more detailed in a later tutorial on automated matching, where we have many more fine-grained distinctions, like \"the justification for asserting this mapping is that the label of the subject matches to an exact synonym of the object after applying 'stemming' during preprocessing\". Nevertheless, modelling human curation better is one of the future goals of SSSOM. The key is to document \"curation rules\", which contain the conditions and assumptions made by the (human) mapping author when asserting the mapping. In the absence of a formal element (at least at the time of this writing, May 2022), you should try and document such curation rules in the comment field. Basic provenance metadata : mapping_date : The date the mapping was asserted. Why is this important? Time of an assertion is essential provenance. It allows us to prefer assertions (mapping decisions) that were done later, but it also gives us a hint how old a mapping is, in particular if the source versions are not, or cannot, be documented. It is a very easy element to document, and we should try to do that at all times. author_id : Identifies the persons or groups responsible for asserting the mappings. The author is a crucial bit of metadata, in particular in conjunction with the mapping justification human curation . A mapping consumer can look up the author of a mapping through their unique identifier (e.g. an ORCiD , which we use in the biomedical domain, but might be anything, including a unique database identifier). Again, we prefer PURLs here, that resolve to some useful information when you look them up. mapping_set_id : A unique identifier of the mapping set. This is a pivotal concept in FAIR data and data management in general: every unit of data that is shared around within an organisation (or the whole world) should have a unique identifier . As per Semantic Web conventions, we recommend using persistent URLs, or PURLs, to identify your mappings set. For example: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.owl is a unique identifier to an ontology and http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo/mapping/mondo.sssom.tsv refers to the \"Mondo disease mappings\". mapping_set_version : The version of a mapping set. Versioning is absolutely crucial for mapping sets, much the same way as it is for ontologies. We recommend to use semantic versioning or simple ISO Date versioning, like \"2022-05-01\". The latter is recommended by some organisations like the OBO foundry (it is easier to see how new a mapping set is, and it is easier to sort as a string), but semantic versioning is much more widely used. We use date based versioning in the tutorial. mapping_set_description : A description of the mapping set, providing context and motivation. This is another underrated piece of metadata that allows humans to understand and build trust towards a mapping set. A good description of a mapping set describes the scope and content of a mapping set describes the purpose for the creation of the mapping set is reasonably short, but not too short (3-4 sentences) license : An identifier for a license description. One of the most serious impediments to re-use on the web is the absence of clear and standardised licenses. We recommend the creative commons licenses for open data, either CC-0 (public domain, no license) or CC-BY 4.0. (Some people prefer CC-BY 4.0, because it ensures that attribution is taken more seriously.) Even when using a proprietary license, it is good to be transparent here, so that an \"accidentally leaked\" data file is not mistakenly assumed to be \"open\". subject_source : URI of source the subject. This is one of the most important pieces of metadata: an unambiguous reference to a source. It is notoriously hard to standardise source references ( see past debate ). We recommend to use the standard URIs used in your own domain, for example OBO ( obo:mondo ) or Wikidata ( wikidata:Q7876491 ). subject_source_version : The version of the source of the subject. In order to interpret a mapping, it is not enough to know the source. Sources changes all the time, whether they are database and/or ontology: classes are obsoleted, database records are deleted. What counts for an exact mapping may change through the evolution of a source. Always document the source version, if you can. This can be very difficult for database systems that do not have a real notion of versioning. object_source : URI of source the object. See subject_source . object_source_version : The version of the source of the object. See subject_source_version .","title":"Adding rich metadata"},{"location":"tutorial/#mapping-vs-mapping-set-metadata-where-should-it-go","text":"SSSOM distinguishes between mapping and mapping_set metadata, i.e. metadata that pertains to each individual mapping and metadata that pertains to the whole mapping set.

We have done this a lot so far during this tutorial: documenting our confidence in our mapping decision, and specifying the source of our subject id. However, in SSSOM we have the option to document some mapping metadata on the level of the mapping_set , which means that the metadata item applies to all mappings in the mapping set .

In this tutorial, only mapping_set_id , mapping_set_version , license and mapping_set_description are purely mapping_set metadata. Everything else is considered mapping metadata. Mapping set metadata is captured in YAML format.

Note that while the object_source resolves to an actual page on the web ( FOODON ), KF_FOOD:DB does not. SSSOM requires a source to correspond to an IRI (see ongoing debate ). This helps to ensure that it is unambiguously clear what the source was. Imagine someone documenting the string INTERNAL_DB or just DB - even in large organisations, but certainly on the web, this can cause clashes. The curie_map (better known as \"prefix map\") is another key concept in SSSOM (and most Semantic Web standards). It maps prefixes to URI expansions. This serves three main purposes. Unambiguously identify the namespace of a prefix. The prefix FOODON: , all by itself, can be used by many different sources. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_ uniquely identifies the namespace of FOODON . This is important when merging different mapping sets together. Expanding and resolving identifiers. Some identifier schemes like the one in the OBO Foundry, Wikidata and many others, resolve identifiers to a page on the web. This allows people (and sometimes machines) to look up additional information about an entity on the web. For example, when we expand FOODON:00002473 to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_00002473, we can look this URI up in a browser. Providing a recipe for creating RDF resources from CURIEs. RDF requires an entity to be represented by a full URI, e.g. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_00002473 . In this case, you can think of the curie_map in essence as a set of RDF prefix declarations . This is only important if your use case requires serialisation into RDF. This concludes the manual curation tutorial.

There are essentially three options: All metadata is stored as values in columns. While this is definitely possible, it is not ideal for a few reasons: It is highly redundant. If we have to store the mapping_set_id , for example, as a value in a mapping table with 1000 mappings, it is repeated 1000 times. It is less immediately clear whether a piece of metadata pertains to the mapping_set or a mapping (you have to study the specification to understand that author_id pertains to an individual mapping rather than the whole mapping set). Metadata about the mapping set is stored within the TSV file header. Basically, we introduce a number of rows at the top of the TSV file that we reserve for metadata. The disadvantage is that many parsers for such flat files do not know how to deal with a header like this. We keep metadata about tables and mapping sets separate, i.e. we keep one TSV file that contains the data and one YAML file that contains the mapping set metadata. This is often a good option, but keeping the two separate may cause a problem: in environments where the data is shared around (emailed, copied) the connection can get lost. In SSSOM, we opted for option 2 as the default, which we call \"embedded mode\" (the metadata is embedded). Most commands in the SSSOM toolkit expect SSSOM files to be in embedded mode. However, we support option 3 (external mode) indirectly by providing operations to simply merge the two before other processing steps.","title":"Embedded vs external mode for SSSOM metadata"},{"location":"tutorial/#converting-an-sssom-file-from-from-external-to-embedded-mode","text":"If you do not have the SSSOM toolkit installed, do so now .

The word \"mapping\" is pretty overloaded in practice: for some people, it simply means \"a correspondence of one term to another equivalent or near equivalent term.\" But even here, there is little understanding to what a \"term\" is in this sentence, or what \"almost equivalent\" means - and, there are many different kinds of mappings used in practice that are not \"equivalent\" at all. In its very essence, an individual mapping maps one information entity, i.e. a representation of a real world entity , to another information entity - how, and what these strings could be, will be the subject of the following section. In the following, we consider an information entity a sequence of characters which has a well defined relationship to some thing in the real world , for example: - an ontology id like HP:0004934 corresponds to the concept of \"Vascular calcification\" in the real world. Note that HP:0004934 is annotated with the rdfs:label \"Vascular calcification\". The label itself is not necessarily a term - it could change, for example to \"Abnormal calcification of the vasculature\", and still retain the same meaning. - \"Vascular calcification\" may be a term in my controlled vocabulary which I understand to correspond to that respective disease (not all controlled vocabularies have IDs for their terms). This happens for example in clinical data models that do not use formal identifiers to refer to the values of slots in their data model, like \"MARRIED\" in /datamodel/marital_status. - Examples of terms: - IDs of classes in an ontology - elements of a clinical value set - codes of clinical terminologies such as Z63.1 - TLDR: terms correspond to things in the world and that correspondence is not subject to change. Labels can change without changing the meaning of a term. An attempt at a practical categorisation In our experience, there are roughly four kinds of mappings: string-string : Relating one string, or label, to another string, or label. Understanding such mappings is fundamental to understanding all the other kinds of mappings. string-term : Relating a specific string or \"label\" to their corresponding term in a terminology or ontology. We usually refer to these as synonyms, but there may be other words used in this case. term-term : Relating a term, for example a class in an ontology, to another term. This is what most people in the ontology domain would understand when thy hear \"ontology mappings\". complex mappings : Relating two sets of terms. These are the rarest and most complicated kinds of mappings, as they related for example two phenotypic profiles (sets of phenotypes) with each other. We will discuss some more examples in a future lesson. In some ways, these four kinds of mappings can be very different. We do believe, however, that there are enough important commonalities such as common features, widely overlapping use cases and overlapping toolkits to consider them together. In the following, we will discuss these in more detail, including important features of mappings and useful tools. Important features of mappings Mappings have historically been neglected as second-class citizens in the medical terminology and ontology worlds - the metadata is insufficient to allow for precise analyses and clinical decision support, they are frequently stale and out of date, etc. The question \"Where can I find the canonical mappings between X and Y\"? is often shrugged off and developers are pointed to aggregators such as OxO or UMLS which combine manually curated mappings with automated ones causing \"mapping hairballs\" . There are many important metadata elements to consider, but the ones that are by far the most important to consider one way or another are: Precision : Is the mapping exact, broad or merely closely related? Confidence : Do I trust the mapping? Was is done manually by an expert in my domain, or by an algorithm? Source version : Which version of the term (or its corresponding ontology) was mapped? Is there a newer mapping which has a more suitable match for my term? Whenever you handle mappings (either create, or re-use), make sure you are keenly aware of at least these three metrics, and capture them. You may even want to consider using a proper mapping model like the Simple Shared Standard for Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) which will make your mappings FAIR and reusable. String-string mappings String-string mappings are mappings that relate two strings. The task of matching two strings is ubiquitous for example in database search fields (where a user search string needs to be mapped to some strings in a database). Most, if not all effective ontology matching techniques will employ some form of string-string matching. For example, to match simple variations of labels such as \"abnormal heart\" and \"heart abnormality\", various techniques such as Stemming and bag of words can be employed effectively. Other techniques such as edit-distance or Levenshtein can be used to quantify the similarity of two strings, which can provide useful insights into mapping candidates. String-term mappings / synonyms String-term mappings relate a specific string or \"label\" to their corresponding term in a terminology or ontology. Here, we refer to these as \"synonyms\", but there may be other cases for string-term mappings beyond synonymy. There are a lot of use cases for synonyms so we will name just a few here that are relevant to typical workflows of Semantic Engineers in the life sciences. Thesauri are reference tools for finding synonyms of terms. Modern ontologies often include very rich thesauri, with some ontologies like Mondo capturing more than 70,000 exact and 35,000 related synonyms. They can provide a huge boost to traditional NLP pipelines by providing synonyms that can be used for both Named Entity Recognition and Entity Resolution. Some insight on how, for example, Uberon was used to boost text mining can be found here . Term-term mappings / ontology mappings Term-term mappings relate a term, for example a class in an ontology, to another term, usually from another ontology or database. The term-term case of mappings is what most people in the ontology domain would understand when they hear \"ontology mappings\". This is also what most people understand when they here \"Entity Resolution\" in the database world - the task of determining whether, in essence, two rows in a database correspond to the same thing (as an example of a tool doing ER see deepmatcher , or py-entitymatcher ). For a list standard entity matching toolkit outside the ontology sphere see here . Further reading A great overview can be found in \"Tackling the challenges of matching biomedical ontologies\" (Faria et al 2018) A yearly competition of ontology matching systems is held by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) . The challenge results are a useful guide to identifying systems for matching you may want to try. Some examples of domain-specific mapping of importance to the biomedical domain Phenotype ontology mappings Mapping phenotypes across species holds great promise for leveraging the knowledge generated by Model Organism Database communities (MODs) for understanding human disease. There is a lot of work happening at the moment (2021) to provide standard mappings between species specific phenotype ontologies to drive translational research ( example ). Tools such as Exomiser leverage such mappings to perform clinical diagnostic tasks such as variant prioritisation. Another app you can try out that leverages cross-species mappings is the Monarch Initiatives Phenotype Profile Search . Disease ontology mappings Medical terminology and ontology mapping is a huge deal in medical informatics ( example ). Mondo is a particularly rich source of well provenanced disease ontology mappings. How should you map your data to ontologies? There are no one size fits all strategies for mapping your data to ontologies. There are many research areas that have something to give in this process. Here, we outline some ideas on how to think about the problem.

Labels can change without changing the meaning of a term.","title":"What is a mapping?"},{"location":"explanation/mappings/#an-attempt-at-a-practical-categorisation","text":"In our experience, there are roughly four kinds of mappings: string-string : Relating one string, or label, to another string, or label. Understanding such mappings is fundamental to understanding all the other kinds of mappings. string-term : Relating a specific string or \"label\" to their corresponding term in a terminology or ontology. We usually refer to these as synonyms, but there may be other words used in this case. term-term : Relating a term, for example a class in an ontology, to another term. This is what most people in the ontology domain would understand when thy hear \"ontology mappings\". complex mappings : Relating two sets of terms. These are the rarest and most complicated kinds of mappings, as they related for example two phenotypic profiles (sets of phenotypes) with each other. We will discuss some more examples in a future lesson. In some ways, these four kinds of mappings can be very different. We do believe, however, that there are enough important commonalities such as common features, widely overlapping use cases and overlapping toolkits to consider them together. In the following, we will discuss these in more detail, including important features of mappings and useful tools.","title":"An attempt at a practical categorisation"},{"location":"explanation/mappings/#important-features-of-mappings","text":"Mappings have historically been neglected as second-class citizens in the medical terminology and ontology worlds - the metadata is insufficient to allow for precise analyses and clinical decision support, they are frequently stale and out of date, etc. The question \"Where can I find the canonical mappings between X and Y\"? is often shrugged off and developers are pointed to aggregators such as OxO or UMLS which combine manually curated mappings with automated ones causing \"mapping hairballs\" . There are many important metadata elements to consider, but the ones that are by far the most important to consider one way or another are: Precision : Is the mapping exact, broad or merely closely related? Confidence : Do I trust the mapping? Was is done manually by an expert in my domain, or by an algorithm? Source version : Which version of the term (or its corresponding ontology) was mapped? Is there a newer mapping which has a more suitable match for my term? Whenever you handle mappings (either create, or re-use), make sure you are keenly aware of at least these three metrics, and capture them. You may even want to consider using a proper mapping model like the Simple Shared Standard for Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) which will make your mappings FAIR and reusable.","title":"Important features of mappings"},{"location":"explanation/mappings/#string-string-mappings","text":"String-string mappings are mappings that relate two strings. The task of matching two strings is ubiquitous for example in database search fields (where a user search string needs to be mapped to some strings in a database). Most, if not all effective ontology matching techniques will employ some form of string-string matching. For example, to match simple variations of labels such as \"abnormal heart\" and \"heart abnormality\", various techniques such as Stemming and bag of words can be employed effectively. Other techniques such as edit-distance or Levenshtein can be used to quantify the similarity of two strings, which can provide useful insights into mapping candidates.","title":"String-string mappings"},{"location":"explanation/mappings/#string-term-mappings-synonyms","text":"String-term mappings relate a specific string or \"label\" to their corresponding term in a terminology or ontology. Here, we refer to these as \"synonyms\", but there may be other cases for string-term mappings beyond synonymy. There are a lot of use cases for synonyms so we will name just a few here that are relevant to typical workflows of Semantic Engineers in the life sciences. Thesauri are reference tools for finding synonyms of terms. Modern ontologies often include very rich thesauri, with some ontologies like Mondo capturing more than 70,000 exact and 35,000 related synonyms. They can provide a huge boost to traditional NLP pipelines by providing synonyms that can be used for both Named Entity Recognition and Entity Resolution.
