      Curation rules often involve complex domain-specific considerations, which are hard to capture in an automated fashion. The curation
      rule should be captured as a resource (entity reference) rather than a string (see curation_rule element), which enables higher levels of transparency and sharing across mapping sets.
      The textual representation of curation rule is intended to be used in cases where (1) the creation of a resource is not practical from the
      perspective of the mapping_provider and (2) as an additional piece of metadata to augment the curation_rule element with a human readable text.
