        description: >-
          Each mapping within a mapping set MAY be identified by a unique, opaque record
          identifier. This slot MUST be used consistently, in that either all mappings in
          the set have a such a record identifier, or none of them have one. The
          behaviour when a set contains both mappings with a record identifier and
          mappings without a record identifier is unspecified. The behaviour when two
          mappings have the same record identifier is unspecified.
