# Contributing to SSSOM

:+1: First of all: Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to SSSOM. They are derived from the excellent contribution guidelines for the [SSSOM Editor](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [SSSOM Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [a member of the SSSOM core team](contact.md).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!


We have an official message board with a detailed FAQ and where the community chimes in with helpful advice if you have questions.

* [Github Discussions](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/discussions)
* [SSSOM FAQ](faq.md)

## What should I know before I get started?

- Read the [overview](spec.md)
- Do the [SSSOM tutorial](tutorial.md)
- Read about the [SSSOM toolkit](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom-py), which is managed [in a different repo](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom-py)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for SSSOM. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Wherever available, use [existing issue tracker templates](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/issues/new/choose), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [discussions](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/discussions)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Decide whether the issue should be reported in the tracker for the [SSSOM data model](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/issues) or the tracker for the [SSSOM toolkit](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom-py/issues)**.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report or Feature request?

Bugs and feature requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug or feature is related to, create an issue on that repository providing the information required by [the appropriate template](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/issues/new/choose).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem/requests.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started SSSOM, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started SSSOM otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an SSSOM command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of SSSOM toolkit/model are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `sssom --version` in your terminal
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to SSSOM? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain SSSOM's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible data model and toolkit
- Enable a sustainable system for SSSOM's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the pull request template (you will see them when you open a pull request).
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
