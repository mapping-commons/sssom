# Contact

The preferred way to contact the SSSOM team is through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/issues) (for problems with SSSOM) or the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/discussions) (for general questions).

You can find any of the members of the SSSOM core team on GitHub:

https://github.com/orgs/mapping-commons/teams/sssom-core

Their GitHub profiles usually also provide email addresses.

You can also reach us in the [OBO Foundry Slack](https://obo-communitygroup.slack.com/archives/C01DP18L5GW), in the `#sssom` channel.
