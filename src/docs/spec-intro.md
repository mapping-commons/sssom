# Specification of the SSSOM standard

This document is the official specification for the SSSOM standard.

It is divided in two sections covering the two different components of the standard:

* the specification for the [data model](spec-model.md), to manipulate SSSOM mappings and mapping sets in your programs;
* the specification for the [serialisation formats](spec-formats.md), to read, write, and exchange SSSOM mapping sets.

Both sections are _normative_. Within those sections, the key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
