Where: Virtual event at the Center for Computational Biomedicine, Harvard Medical School, see

When: Monday 12 Dec 2022

Speaker: Nicolas Matentzoglu, PhD, Independent Contractor, Semantic Web and Knowledge Graphs expert

Abstract: In this seminar, we will discuss the role of entity mappings in the biomedical domain, and the potential gain we might get from standardising and sharing them. We will introduce the Simple Standard of Ontological Mappings (SSSOM, https://w3id.org/sssom) and showcase some of its use cases. The central goal of this seminar is to redefine entity mappings as FAIR semantic artefacts in their own right, thus making them first-class citizens alongside, for example, controlled vocabularies and ontologies.
