Abstract: 
The Simple Standard for Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) was first published in December
2021 (v. 0.9). After a number of revisions prompted by community feedback, we have
published version 0.10.1 in August 2022. One of the key new features is the use of a controlled
vocabulary for mapping-related processes, such as preprocessing steps and matching
approaches. In this paper, we give an update on the development of SSSOM since v. 0.9,
introduce the Semantic Mapping Vocabulary (SEMAPV) and outline some of our thoughts on
the establishment of mapping commons in the future.
