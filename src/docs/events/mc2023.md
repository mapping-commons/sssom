# 2nd Mapping Commons Workshop on Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings

When: Sunday, 23rd April, 2:30 pm.
Where: co-located with [Biocuration 2023](https://biocuration2023.github.io/). For information about the venue see https://biocuration2023.github.io/workshops.

During the workshop, we will work a lot with slido rather than relying on open discussions. We recommend to have your laptop / phone with you to be able to participate.

## Recommended preparation

- Scroll through [the documentation](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/home/), in particular [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baac035) and the [basic tutorial](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/tutorial/) to get a basic sense of SSSOM
- Skip through, or even watch, the [SSSOM CCB Seminar recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vqeRECuAKE)
- Scroll through the slide decks describing the problems we will be adressing (note, they are all works in progress):
    - [Complex Mappings: Examples from OMOP2OBO (Tiffany Callahan)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Jn0W9gjRn19ISDB8N-sEwKwXsJySLPlNIsOL6ng_nEA/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Complex mappings - the journey towards a proposal (Nico Matentzoglu)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kFD33S_WMgEGmCnT7IjVCeEyKI7OpcUw1ZzRXGqt1hs/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Literal mappings with SSSOM (James McLaughlin)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mBZK6KS7JgmXlEtszQiOa_Cl7SXg_Z8wRp0tZHaL57Y/edit?usp=sharing)
    - FAIR Impact and schema mappings (Yann Le Franc) - slides TBD
    - Solving schema mappings with LinkML Transformer (Chris Mungall) - slides TBD
    - Concept and Value Set Mappings (Chris Roeder) - slides TBD
