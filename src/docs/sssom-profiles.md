### Literal Mappings

The SSSOM profile for literal mappings is a version of SSSOM that allows the dissemination and standardisation of mappings between identifers and literals.

As of 01.08.2023, the first version of this profile has been published, and it is still subject to change. We recommend to reach out on the [SSSOM issue tracker](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom/issues) if you are interested in using the literal profile. Note: we dont expect there to be any major breaking changes.
