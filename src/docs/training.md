- [Are these two entities the same? A guide.](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/are-two-entities-the-same/). An important tutorial that explains that it is not directly possible to determine if two things are the same across ontologies, but its still worth doing when explicitly recording the rationale.
- [Linking across vocabularies: Semantic Entity Matching](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/lesson/entity-matching/): Entity matching is the process of establishing a link between an identifier in one semantic space to an identifier in another. There are many cultures of thought around entity matching, including Ontology Matching, Entity Resolution and Entity Linking.
