# The JSON serialisation format

The JSON serialisation format is currently unspecified.

It is intended as a more-or-less direct serialisation of the `MappingSet` class into the JSON format as specified by [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259), but many details of the serialisation are left unspecified for now.
