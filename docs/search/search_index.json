The idea of a mapping commons is to provide mappings in a decentralised fashion akin to OBO ontologies. A mapping commons collects mappings relevant to a particular community, either by reference (i.e. pulling in mapping sets already published elsewhere), or directly maintained at the mapping commons ( example ). Their integration as part of a repository (mapping server) would look like EBI's Ontology X-ref Browser or BioPortal , but the exact scope of these repositories is use case dependent - EBI may chose to show cross references from and to ontologies loaded into OLS, while BioPortal chooses to show a different set of mappings. The plan is to update EBI's OxO to support the full SSSOM data model, drawing curated mappings from a variety of mapping commons, by Summer 2022 - but its unlikely that one central place will index all available mappings. Who is responsible for the conversion into SSSOM - the primary developers of an artefact, or a mapping commons? Like with everything on the web, the closer to the source the SSSOM mappings are curated, the better. Ideally, mappings are maintained as part of ontology release pipelines or by primary mapping creators, rather than derived from a secondary source such as a database, further downstream. The reason for this is that ideally, we would want mappings to be reviewable and editable in much the same way as open ontologies, offering issue trackers and an active community incorporating changes. That said, it is unlikely that all existing mappings will be maintained by the source directly. For example, we expect to maintain the SSSOM mappings derived from the vast majority of OBO ontology xrefs as a downstream task ( example ). How dependent are we on the sssom-py toolkit? SSSOM follows the core design principle that mapping tables should be (a) self-contained, i.e. including its prefix maps similar to a turtle file, and (b) readable by normal data science toolkits. An SSSOM table can be read with pandas using the comment='#' parameter (with one caveat, which is that # must be used as a character solely to denote comments), or a very simply combination of a yaml reader and pandas. The SSSOM toolkit however offers some extra functionality, like export to JSON-LD, or RDF or import from other frequently used format. Is the concept of a \"mapping server\" equivalent, complementary, or antagonistic to the existing ontology repositories? A (SSSOM) mapping server is a repository for mappings that enables the browsing of existing mappings, exposing all (or some relevant subset of) SSSOM metadata as search facets. In that sense, it should be considered complementary, as it enables the search for accurate mappings from a specific term or set of terms, something that goes beyond what most ontologies would offer. However, the concept of ontology mappings can be perceived as antagonistic to Open Ontology principles, as its goal is not the logical integration of knowledge, but the association or linking of terms across controlled semantic spaces . The OBO vision involves the building of a coherent, non-redundant semantic space of logically interconnected ontologies, which in particular wants to avoid the introduction of overlapping concepts. The mapping world specifically embraces heterogenous semantic spaces and overlapping concepts, and seeks to bridge the semantic gaps using well-defined mapping relations such as \"skos:broadMatch\" or \"owl:equivalentClass\".","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#is-there-a-central-repository-of-sssom-files","text":"The idea of a mapping commons is to provide mappings in a decentralised fashion akin to OBO ontologies. A mapping commons collects mappings relevant to a particular community, either by reference (i.e. pulling in mapping sets already published elsewhere), or directly maintained at the mapping commons ( example ). Their integration as part of a repository (mapping server) would look like EBI's Ontology X-ref Browser or BioPortal , but the exact scope of these repositories is use case dependent - EBI may chose to show cross references from and to ontologies loaded into OLS, while BioPortal chooses to show a different set of mappings. The plan is to update EBI's OxO to support the full SSSOM data model, drawing curated mappings from a variety of mapping commons, by Summer 2022 - but its unlikely that one central place will index all available mappings.","title":"Is there a central repository of SSSOM files?"},{"location":"faq/#who-is-responsible-for-the-conversion-into-sssom-the-primary-developers-of-an-artefact-or-a-mapping-commons","text":"Like with everything on the web, the closer to the source the SSSOM mappings are curated, the better.

SSSOM seeks to solve, in particular, the following problems: Standardising the mapping metadata that is necessary to drive data transformation and knowledge graph merging use cases Enable effective merging and filtering of mapping sets Standardising the representation of mapping sets across formats such as RDF/XML, JSON-LD, TSV, and others. The purpose of this 3-hour workshop: Describing current use cases to the community, and ensuring all community use cases are documented and understood Establishing a user forum for getting support and providing feedback Define a simple governance strategy for organic evolution of standard Describing a number of key open issues: The representation of complex mappings The representation of curation rules The problem of predicate modification The alignment with external standards such as PROV-O and Alignment API Defining the path to a SSSOM beta release (stable) and the rallying for the paper Resources : Overview presentation Outcomes Members of the SSSOM core team are organised as as github team: https://github.com/orgs/mapping-commons/teams/sssom-core If you want to become a member, please make an issue here: https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues We added some of the questions asked to the new SSSOM FAQ: https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/faq/ Governance proposal (comments welcome): https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues/82 Governance will evolve over time. Standard and governance will evolve together. We will versioning (like SemVer) and should denote when backwards incompatible changes happen The 5-Star system for open FAIR mappings is now in its first official version. Discussion summary Ben Gyori: would be interesting to discuss beyond the format whether there's a central repository, or whether primary developers will make it as a primary export hosted along with their other artifact. Would there be a process to pull those? Nico: takes a long time for uptake of new publication systems, so this could take a long time -> maybe better to promote on an ontology level. Could also have the side benefit of providing a point of introspection John G: I totally would want BioPortal to be capable of managing the RDF produced from SSSOM resources, and for Bioportal to be a mapping resource and not simply an ontology resource. I suspect the RDF patterns that SSSOM is defining are the gold we'll need for that gold standard for exchanging mappings. Uploading the RDF files can trivially be done in a naive way of course, but integrating that RDF knowledge into Bioportal to make them maximally useful as a separate kind of resource is obviously 'real work' (and so schedules are unknowable). John: how dependent is the library on the software itself? Is it an exchange principle? Nico: LinkML has the advantage that it gets JSON and TTL outputs for free if we use it. Would also be advantageous if more people used this standard for metamodeling to create similar outputs for different modeling Charlie: using \"frontmatter\" format for SSSOM TSV files, like how github is using frontmatter in Jekyll (ref: https://blog.datacite.org/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv/) (http://csvy.org/) John G: Analogous to frontmatter format, I keep being drawn to the SKOS Play format as an alternate (but I think TTL-compatible) format for the SSSOM content. How bad would that be? (I can create a ticket) Charlie: Requirements for a default JSON-LD context (e.g., prefix -> URL prefix mapping) How should it be maintained? Should it continue to be manually curated, or is an automated export from something like the Bioregistry a good idea? If it's automatically exported from the Bioregistry, what kinds of interactions might users want to have via the Bioregistry issue tracker to propose improvements? Similarly, we can make tutorials for directly creating PRs. Charlie: How prefixes should be stylized/what is the business logic/decision tree for using OBO Library PURLs, Identifiers.org URLs, Bioregistry URLs, first-party provider URLs, etc. based on what's available and mapped between various first-party providers, third-party providers (e.g., ChemSpider InChI resolver), and meta-providers (e.g., Identifiers.org, OntoBee)? This is both a concern for \"best practices\" in SSSOM defining a custom context and also when using or extending the default context. Charlie: How to represent mappings where the curator is unsure if the relation is correct or not? This happens often when curating equivalences, e.g., in Biomappings https://github.com/biomappings/biomappings/blob/master/src/biomappings/resources/unsure.tsv Tiffany: Is it important to know why someone feels more or less confident about a mapping? If so, is there also a way to include that in the measure of \u201cconfidence\u201d? Sue: In practice I\u2019ve tended to add comments when I am uncertain and have questions. Possibly this could be formalized? Davera clinical use case discussion: Overall issue: mapping sets of things to a term is a goal for clinical mappings mapping recommendations/rational exercise staging and diagnosis information (like stage 1 or stage 2 of a given cancer) Select a set of stages - this is challenging wrt mappings Different kinds of scales describing the same thing are hard/sometimes not \"kosher\" to mix Phenotypes rely on capturing human-readable data on the decision logic of how mappings are applied by standards implementation team Proposed to look at the HL7 Implementation profiles as a way to incorporate an approach to this complex mapping challenge Melissa: rename SSSOM to Slytherin Standard. Charlie 100% supports this (Tiffany: +1; Alex +1) Kristin also likes this. John used it. John G: Ontology repositories are mappings-motivated, to both provide to users good mappings, and to provide good ways for users or managers to ingest, manage, apply, and create mapping knowledge. Ontology repositories are presumably also capable of storing mappings in their semantic (RDF-equivalent) format. With this in mind, is the concept of a \"mapping server\" equivalent, complementary, or antagonistic to the existing ontology repositories? John G: Need to consider identification and versioning of the mapping artifacts. It's one thing to say \"We have all the mapping artifacts and we are giving those out\", but (just like ontologies) citing a mapping artifact requires that you have a unique identifier for that artifact, and that the identifier incorporates the fact the artifact may have multiple versions. Ideally the SSSOM artifacts (like ontologies) would (a) be accessible in a defined format at the identifier IRI, (b) include their identifiers within the SSMOC artifact. I am thinking that an SSMOC is inherently a semantic artifact, and therefore it should follow semantic namespace declaration principles in this regard.

What metadata could we add to the header to make clear criteria used?

SSSOM seeks to solve, in particular, the following problems: Standardising the mapping metadata that is necessary to drive data transformation and knowledge graph merging use cases Enable effective merging and filtering of mapping sets Standardising the representation of mapping sets across formats such as RDF/XML, JSON-LD, TSV, and others. The purpose of this 3-hour workshop: Describing current use cases to the community, and ensuring all community use cases are documented and understood Establishing a user forum for getting support and providing feedback Define a simple governance strategy for organic evolution of standard Describing a number of key open issues: The representation of complex mappings The representation of curation rules The problem of predicate modification The alignment with external standards such as PROV-O and Alignment API Defining the path to a SSSOM beta release (stable) and the rallying for the paper Resources : Overview presentation","title":"1st Mapping Commons Workshop on Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings"},{"location":"mc2021/#outcomes","text":"Members of the SSSOM core team are organised as as github team: https://github.com/orgs/mapping-commons/teams/sssom-core If you want to become a member, please make an issue here: https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues We added some of the questions asked to the new SSSOM FAQ: https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/faq/ Governance proposal (comments welcome): https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues/82 Governance will evolve over time.

Would there be a process to pull those? Nico: takes a long time for uptake of new publication systems, so this could take a long time -> maybe better to promote on an ontology level. Could also have the side benefit of providing a point of introspection John G: I totally would want BioPortal to be capable of managing the RDF produced from SSSOM resources, and for Bioportal to be a mapping resource and not simply an ontology resource. I suspect the RDF patterns that SSSOM is defining are the gold we'll need for that gold standard for exchanging mappings. Uploading the RDF files can trivially be done in a naive way of course, but integrating that RDF knowledge into Bioportal to make them maximally useful as a separate kind of resource is obviously 'real work' (and so schedules are unknowable). John: how dependent is the library on the software itself? Is it an exchange principle? Nico: LinkML has the advantage that it gets JSON and TTL outputs for free if we use it. Would also be advantageous if more people used this standard for metamodeling to create similar outputs for different modeling Charlie: using \"frontmatter\" format for SSSOM TSV files, like how github is using frontmatter in Jekyll (ref: https://blog.datacite.org/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv/) (http://csvy.org/) John G: Analogous to frontmatter format, I keep being drawn to the SKOS Play format as an alternate (but I think TTL-compatible) format for the SSSOM content. How bad would that be? (I can create a ticket) Charlie: Requirements for a default JSON-LD context (e.g., prefix -> URL prefix mapping) How should it be maintained? Should it continue to be manually curated, or is an automated export from something like the Bioregistry a good idea? If it's automatically exported from the Bioregistry, what kinds of interactions might users want to have via the Bioregistry issue tracker to propose improvements? Similarly, we can make tutorials for directly creating PRs. Charlie: How prefixes should be stylized/what is the business logic/decision tree for using OBO Library PURLs, Identifiers.org URLs, Bioregistry URLs, first-party provider URLs, etc. based on what's available and mapped between various first-party providers, third-party providers (e.g., ChemSpider InChI resolver), and meta-providers (e.g., Identifiers.org, OntoBee)? This is both a concern for \"best practices\" in SSSOM defining a custom context and also when using or extending the default context. Charlie: How to represent mappings where the curator is unsure if the relation is correct or not? This happens often when curating equivalences, e.g., in Biomappings https://github.com/biomappings/biomappings/blob/master/src/biomappings/resources/unsure.tsv Tiffany: Is it important to know why someone feels more or less confident about a mapping? If so, is there also a way to include that in the measure of \u201cconfidence\u201d? Sue: In practice I\u2019ve tended to add comments when I am uncertain and have questions. Possibly this could be formalized? Davera clinical use case discussion: Overall issue: mapping sets of things to a term is a goal for clinical mappings mapping recommendations/rational exercise staging and diagnosis information (like stage 1 or stage 2 of a given cancer) Select a set of stages - this is challenging wrt mappings Different kinds of scales describing the same thing are hard/sometimes not \"kosher\" to mix Phenotypes rely on capturing human-readable data on the decision logic of how mappings are applied by standards implementation team Proposed to look at the HL7 Implementation profiles as a way to incorporate an approach to this complex mapping challenge Melissa: rename SSSOM to Slytherin Standard. Charlie 100% supports this (Tiffany: +1; Alex +1) Kristin also likes this. John used it. John G: Ontology repositories are mappings-motivated, to both provide to users good mappings, and to provide good ways for users or managers to ingest, manage, apply, and create mapping knowledge. Ontology repositories are presumably also capable of storing mappings in their semantic (RDF-equivalent) format. With this in mind, is the concept of a \"mapping server\" equivalent, complementary, or antagonistic to the existing ontology repositories?

However, there is currently little to no standardisation in how such mappings are represented. While properties such as hasDbXref property are widely used in ontologies such as GO and MONDO, the meaning of such mappings is unclear, and cannot be further described with additional metadata or provenance. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) is an initiative to provide a minimal and standard set of elements for the dissemination of mappings between ontology terms, to ensure a reliable interpretation of generated mappings and to enable sharing and data integration between people and applications. This document introduces the SSSOM catalog of metadata elements, which can be used to attach meta- and provenance data to both mappings and sets of mappings; a controlled vocabulary for the description of match types (SSSOM CV); a definition of both RDF and TSV serialisations of ontology mappings; and a (non-exhaustive) selection of recommended mapping predicates. Table of Contents Introduction SSSOM Metadata Elements SSSOM Common Predicates SSSOM Serialisation SSSOM Use Cases SSSOM 5-Star recommendation for mappings Introduction Currently, there are three methods typically used to express mappings in OWL: direct logical axioms using owl:equivalentClass; the oboInOwl hasDbXref property; and the SKOS vocabulary for mapping properties. The first, owl:equivalentClass, is a strong logical equivalence assertion which is not appropriate for more nuanced mappings such as close matches. The second, hasDbXref, does not assert formal logical equivalence but also has no clearly defined meaning. Finally, the SKOS vocabulary provides a hierarchy of mapping properties which allow the unambigous specification of exact, close, broad, and narrow matches, but does not provide the means for mappings to be annotated with additional metadata such as confidence scores and provenance. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) addresses these problems by defining a catalog of metadata terms to describe mappings. Both individual mappings and sets of mappings can be described, enabling provenance and metadata to be captured on multiple levels. SSSOM interoperates with existing methods for the specification of mappings, allowing any predicate to be used to describe the nature of each mapping including those from OWL and SKOS. The provenance of mappings - such as whether the mapping was created as the result of a human-curated equivalence match, or a semantic similarity match - is specified using a controlled vocabulary (CV), SSSOM CV. Combined with the metadata properties provided by SSSOM such as confidence and semantic_similarity_score, this provenance information can be used to capture mapping descriptions in a manner that is explicit and amenable to curation. Two serialisations for SSSOM mappings are provided in this document, aimed at different communities: an RDF/OWL serialisation using IRIs that is aimed at the Knowledge Graph/Semantic Web community, and a TSV serialisation using CURIE syntax which is aimed at the wider bioinformatics community. An unambiguous translation between these serialisations is provided. Some notes on the standardisation process: Note this is a public copy of the editors\u2019 draft. It is provided for discussion only and may change at any moment. Do not cite this document other than as work in progress. SSSOM is community-driven, so all feedback is welcome. SSSOM Metadata Elements The SSSOM specification defines a set of SSSOM metadata elements that are used to describe mappings. Apart from the elements themselves, some example usage and a description, the SSSOM spec defines the canonical order for the metadatdata in which the elements should appear when serialised. This precludes spurious diffs in a git setting, which is an important concern for the continuous reviewing of mappings by curators and users. A \"term\" is defined in a controlled vocabulary / ontology, and usually corresponds to a class, an individual or a property (entity in OWL, concept in SKOS, resource in RDF). The \"subject\" is the term on the left side of the mapping, and the \"object\" is the term on the right side of the mapping. A \"predicate\" relates the subject with the object and is typically an annotation or object property. A \"mapping set\" is a set of mappings that can be shared using the SSSOM standard. The conceptual model of SSSOM has two main elements: a Mapping and a MappingSet . Some SSSOM metadata elements apply only to one element or the other, but many can be applied to both. Note that some SSSOM metadata elements have known equivalent properties which will be used in the RDF serialisation, for example see_also is mapped to rdfs:seeAlso . All metadata elements and their mappings are declared and managed in the SSSOM schema . Metadata Element Table Note: this table may be a bit out of date. The latest version of the metadata elements are: Mapping MappingSet Element ID Description TSV Example RDF example scope req. subject_id The ID of the subject of the mapping.

Sources: https://www.bioontology.org/wiki/BioPortal_Mappings Predicate Description owl:sameAs The subject and the object are instances (owl individuals), and the two instances are the same. owl:equivalentClass The subject and the object are classes (owl class), and the two classes are the same. owl:equivalentProperty The subject and the object are properties (owl object, data, annotation properties), and the two properties are the same. rdfs:subClassOf The subject and the object are classes (owl class), and the subject is a subclass of the object. rdfs:subPropertyOf The subject and the object are properties (owl object, data, annotation properties), and the subject is a subproperty of the object. skos:relatedMatch The subject and the object are associated in some unspecified way. skos:closeMatch The subject and the object are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. skos:exactMatch The subject and the object can, with a high degree of confidence, be used interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval applications. skos:narrowMatch From the SKOS primer: A triple skos:narrower (and skos:narrowMatch) asserts that , the object of the triple, is a narrower concept than , the subject of the triple. skos:broadMatch From the SKOS primer: A triple skos:broader (and skos:broadMatch) asserts that , the object of the triple, is a broader concept than , the subject of the triple. oio:database_cross_reference Two terms are related in some way. The meaning is frequently consistent across a single set of mappings. Note this property is often overloaded even where the terms are of a different nature (e.g. interpro2go) rdfs:seeAlso The subject and the object are associated in some unspecified way. The object IRI often resolves to a resource on the web that provides additional information. RO:? Any Relation in the Relation Ontology (RO). Serialisation RDF/XML serialised re-ified OWL axioms: The default RDFXML serialisation of the mappings will be realised as reified OWL axioms . This has the advantage that any mapping set can be simply merged with an ontology in the usual way, for example using ROBOT merge . We will deal with three types of reified OWL-axioms, and a few sub-types: Predicate is an annotation property Predicate is an object property and Object/Subject are classes Object/Subject are individuals Predicate is language relational construct of RDFS or OWL (rdfs:subClassOf, owl:equivalentClass) Predicate is an annotation property: If the predicate corresponds to an annotation property, the mapping gets converted to an OWLAnnotationAssertion axiom: OWLAnnotationAssertion(P,S,O) . All mapping level metadata ( sssomMetadata ) gets converted into OWLAnnotation objects which are materialised as axiom annotations on the mapping annotation assertion, see OWL 2 Structural Specification : AnnotationAssertion(sssomMetadata P, S, O) Where sssomMetadata is a sequence of OWL Annotations objects like: Annotation(Q1,V1) Annotation(Q2,V2) ... Annotation(Qn,Vn) where Qi is a SSSOM metadata element and Vi is an annotation value. Note that if a SSSOM metadata element value is a list L (i.e. can have multiple elements, such as creator and others), individual annotations are created for each of them: Annotation(Q,V) for all V in L. Example: AnnotationAssertion(Annotation(sssom:creator_id <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779>) Annotation(sssom:match_type sssom:LexicalEquivalenceMapping) skos:exactMatch <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0009894> <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_0000019>) Mapping set level annotations are manifested as Ontology annotation in the usual way, according to the OWL 2 Structural Specification . Predicate is an object property Case 1: Object and Subject are classes. The Mapping gets translated into an existential restriction: SubclassOf(A, P some O) All metadata elements are added as OWLAnnotation objects and added to SubclassOf axiom as axiom annotations: SubclassOf(sssomMetadata, A, P some O) Example: SubClassOf(Annotation(sssom:creator_id <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779>) Annotation(sssom:match_type sssom:LexicalEquivalenceMapping) <http://example.org/AA> ObjectSomeValuesFrom(<http://example.org/x> <http://example.org/BB>)) Case 2: Object and Subject are individuals The Mapping gets translated into an object property assertion: ObjectPropertyAssertion(P, A, O) All metadata elements are added as OWLAnnotation objects and added to ObjectPropertyAssertion axiom as axiom annotations: ObjectPropertyAssertion(sssomMetadata, P, A, O) Example: ObjectPropertyAssertion(Annotation(sssom:creator_id <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779>) Annotation(sssom:match_type sssom:LexicalEquivalenceMapping) <http://www.example.org/x> <http://www.example.org/a> <http://www.example.org/b>) Predicate is language relational construct of RDFS or OWL The mapping gets translated into an annotated axiom that corresponds to the construct used. By default, SSSOM will support: owl:EquivalentClass EquivalentClass(sssomMetadata,A,O) rdfs:subClassOf SubClassOf(sssomMetadata, A,O) Example: SubClassOf(Annotation(sssom:creator_id <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779>) Annotation(sssom:match_type sssom:LexicalEquivalenceMapping) <http://www.example.org/a> <http://www.example.org/b>) TSV: All SSSOM metadata elements labelled with L in the metadata table are permissible as column names in the TSV. List elements (such as creator) are \"|\"-separated. The columns MUST be sorted according to the order as they appear in the SSSOM metadata . For example, the first columns of a mapping set TSV should always be, in that order: subject_id, predicate_id, object_id, match_type, if labels are not included; if they are included, the order should be: subject_id, subject_label, predicate_id, predicate_label, object_id, object_label, match_type. For easier review of diffs, for example git diff or unix diff, we recommend to serialise the TSV by a fixed row order, sorted column by column from left to right. Metadata about a set of mappings can be supplied as part of the mappings (embedded mode) and as a simple yaml file alongside the primary mapping file. Note that for the TSV, it will be required to supply a valid curie map that allows the unambiguous interpretation of CURIEs. A curie map is supplied after a curie_map: parameter in the yaml file. The value can be either a dictionary of CURIE->URLPREFIX pairs or a link to a valid curie map of the same shape. Note that only metadata elements permissible in a global context (G, or L/G) can be used in the metadata-file. We recommend to use the following filename conventions for SSSOM metadatafiles: TSV files should have the extension .sssom.tsv , for example: mp-hp-exact-0.0.1.sssom.tsv . External yaml metadata files should have the extension .sssom.yml , for example mp-hp-exact-0.0.1.sssom.tsv Example ( download ): creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" curie_map: HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" skos: \"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core\" license: \"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" mapping_provider: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno.owl\" External mode In external mode, the mapping set metadata is supplied by a separate YAML file having the same base-name of the mapping file, with the extension -meta.yml . By default, tools will look for the file of that name in the same directory as the the mapping set table. Example ( download ): subject_id predicate_id object_id match_type subject_label object_label HP:0009124 skos:exactMatch MP:0000003 Lexical Abnormal adipose tissue morphology abnormal adipose tissue morphology HP:0008551 skos:exactMatch MP:0000018 Lexical Microtia small ears HP:0000411 skos:exactMatch MP:0000021 Lexical Protruding ear prominent ears Embedded mode (default) In the embedded mode, we allow the integration of mapping set level metadata as commented YAML . Apart from being commented, the YAML follows the exact same spec as the YAML specified by the external mode . Heavily used tools in bioinformatics such as pandas allow to specify comment characters when reading CSV files, which makes this option the most user friendly for this community. Additionally, it is a simple unix-level or language-level operation to filter these as a pre-processing in a robust fashion. Note: the mapping set level metadata must be included as a continuous block at the beginning of the file . This means in particular: - No comments can be included that are not part of the metadata data. For example, this is not allowed: Illegal case 1: #creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" # This is a comment that does not belong here #curie_map: # HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" # MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" Illegal case 2: # This is a comment that does not belong here #creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" #curie_map: # HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" # MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" There should be no empty rows: the commented yaml files must be directly followed by the column headers. For example, this is not allowed: Illegal case 3: #creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" #curie_map: # HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" # MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" The can be only a single # in the beginning of each row, followed immediately by the yaml. When the leading hash-symbol is stripped from the header block, the resulting string is: a valid yaml file conforms to SSSOM mapping set specification (only curie_map or a metadata elements that are allowed on mapping_set level, i.e. global ). After the table header, no further row should be commented out.

Maintain mappings in github/tsvs Rendering Drive-by PRs Providers Autogenerate pages like http://geneontology.org/docs/download-mappings/ http://uberon.github.io/downloads.html#bridge OxO The SSSOM 5-Star System For Mappings Current mappings are extremely hard to use for data integration, because they are: non-transparently imprecise : we do not know whether they are between equivalent terms, or wether one term is broader than the other. non-transparently incomplete : we do not know whether the absence of a mapping means there is none. inaccurate : there are many mappings generated by automated tools that have a low mapping confidence - but still included in mapping sets. unFAIR : there is insufficient metadata attached to mappings and mapping sets to trace their provenance, attribute trust or combine them to exploit cross-walks. In principle, to reach full integration through mappings, you will have to cross-map all ontologies, or semantic spaces (e.g. controlled vocabularies, semantic databases), which means if you have N \"spaces\", you have N x (N - 1) mappings (because A -> B is often different from B -> A). It makes sense to consider mappings as a directed graph from which you can infer other mappings using graph walking or graph traversals . To mitigate the explosion of mappings, we have to be able to cross-walk. While some typical mapping predicates such as owl:equivalentClass or skos:exactMatch are symetric (which means that if A -> B then you can infer B -> A, which we will call a \"walk-back\"), other are not (skos:narrowMatch), but maybe have inverse predicates (A --[skos:narrowMatch]--> B implies B --[skos:broadMatch]--> A). Apart from walk backs, you can infer additional mappings through a chain of subsequent mappings (multi-hop forward walks), for example: - multi-hop forward walks { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304, ncbiprotein:YP_009725304-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627 } --> {PR:000050277 -> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627} ) - walk-backs { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304 } --> {ncbiprotein:YP_009725304 -> PR:000050277} - combinations { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304, ncbiprotein:YP_009725304-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627, MY:NSP8-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627 } --> { PR:000050277 -> MY:NSP8 } To enable cross-walking, we propose the following Five-Star system for mapping sets. 1-Star mappings fulfill the following criteria: record subject id, object id and mapping precision (exact, broad, narrow, close, related) using qualified names (either URIs or CURIEs + curie maps) for subject id and object id using a standard file format (JSON, XML, CSV, TSV) made available in a public space optional : record the subject and object labels to make it easier for humans to read the file 2-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 1-star mappings and furthermore made available in a public version control system with an issue tracker record the semantic predicate explicitly and using qualified names for the semantic predicate (i.e. owl:equivalentClass, skos:exactMatch) record a confidence value for the mapping between 0 and 1 (0 no confidence, 1 100% confidence). record an open license for the use of the mapping set 3-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 2-star mappings and furthermore are exported in SSSOM format record the following additional metadata: match_type (s) (Lexical, Logical match, HumanCurated etc) date of the mapping creator_id subject_source object_source subject_source_version object_source_version mapping_tool if the mapping was automatically computed using a tool 4-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 3-star mappings and furthermore register the mapping at a mapping commons record the following additional metadata: mapping_set_id mapping_set_description mapping_set_version mapping_provider (if the mapping is not original, i.e. it is not derived from another source) provide a completely executable curation_rule: if the mapping is Lexical , provide: subject_preprocessing , object_preprocessing subject_match_field , object_match_field match_string if the mapping is Logical , the mapping should be derivable by a reasoner from a combination of the object_source and subject_source . If more is needed then please leave a comment with details. if the mapping is HumanCurated .. (this needs to be fleshed out . For now, leave a comment indicating what you did to arrive at your conclusion, i.e. wether you compared the definitions, looked up the \"labels\" in a database, ran a tool and decided to trust it etc.) if the mapping is SemanticSimilarity (graph similarity, neighbourhood, cosine similarity), you should provide: semantic_similarity_score semantic_similarity_measure For now, if there are multiple pieces of evidence (lexical, logical etc), please emit one row per evidence. If your tool combines multiple pieces of evidence in a complex way, emit yet another row at the end with match_type Complex and emit ensure you provide the mapping_tool . 5-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 4-star mappings and furthermore Are up-to-date with the subject_source and object_source Have no issue on their issue tracker open for more than 3 months without an interaction Use a standard open license, such as CC Zero 1.0 or CC-BY-4.0 .","title":"SSSOM Specification"},{"location":"spec/#simple-standard-for-sharing-ontology-mappings-sssom","text":"Development Draft (under construction: some metadata fields may be subject to change) Editors: Nicolas Matentzoglu (Semanticly Ltd; @matentzn ) Chris Mungall (LBL) Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz (City, University of London) John Graybeal (Stanford) William Duncan (LBL) David Osumi-Sutherland (EMBL-EBI) Simon Jupp (SciBite) James McLaughlin (EMBL-EBI) Henriette Harmse (EMBL-EBI) Tiffany Callahan ( @callahantiff ) Charlie Hoyt (Harvard Medical School; @cthoyt ) Thomas Liener (Pistoia Alliance) Harshad Hegde (LBL) Contributors: Andrew Williams Anne Thessen Benjamin M.

However, there is currently little to no standardisation in how such mappings are represented. While properties such as hasDbXref property are widely used in ontologies such as GO and MONDO, the meaning of such mappings is unclear, and cannot be further described with additional metadata or provenance. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) is an initiative to provide a minimal and standard set of elements for the dissemination of mappings between ontology terms, to ensure a reliable interpretation of generated mappings and to enable sharing and data integration between people and applications. This document introduces the SSSOM catalog of metadata elements, which can be used to attach meta- and provenance data to both mappings and sets of mappings; a controlled vocabulary for the description of match types (SSSOM CV); a definition of both RDF and TSV serialisations of ontology mappings; and a (non-exhaustive) selection of recommended mapping predicates.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"spec/#table-of-contents","text":"Introduction SSSOM Metadata Elements SSSOM Common Predicates SSSOM Serialisation SSSOM Use Cases SSSOM 5-Star recommendation for mappings","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"spec/#introduction","text":"Currently, there are three methods typically used to express mappings in OWL: direct logical axioms using owl:equivalentClass; the oboInOwl hasDbXref property; and the SKOS vocabulary for mapping properties. The first, owl:equivalentClass, is a strong logical equivalence assertion which is not appropriate for more nuanced mappings such as close matches. The second, hasDbXref, does not assert formal logical equivalence but also has no clearly defined meaning. Finally, the SKOS vocabulary provides a hierarchy of mapping properties which allow the unambigous specification of exact, close, broad, and narrow matches, but does not provide the means for mappings to be annotated with additional metadata such as confidence scores and provenance. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) addresses these problems by defining a catalog of metadata terms to describe mappings. Both individual mappings and sets of mappings can be described, enabling provenance and metadata to be captured on multiple levels. SSSOM interoperates with existing methods for the specification of mappings, allowing any predicate to be used to describe the nature of each mapping including those from OWL and SKOS. The provenance of mappings - such as whether the mapping was created as the result of a human-curated equivalence match, or a semantic similarity match - is specified using a controlled vocabulary (CV), SSSOM CV. Combined with the metadata properties provided by SSSOM such as confidence and semantic_similarity_score, this provenance information can be used to capture mapping descriptions in a manner that is explicit and amenable to curation. Two serialisations for SSSOM mappings are provided in this document, aimed at different communities: an RDF/OWL serialisation using IRIs that is aimed at the Knowledge Graph/Semantic Web community, and a TSV serialisation using CURIE syntax which is aimed at the wider bioinformatics community. An unambiguous translation between these serialisations is provided.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"spec/#some-notes-on-the-standardisation-process","text":"Note this is a public copy of the editors\u2019 draft.

Apart from the elements themselves, some example usage and a description, the SSSOM spec defines the canonical order for the metadatdata in which the elements should appear when serialised. This precludes spurious diffs in a git setting, which is an important concern for the continuous reviewing of mappings by curators and users. A \"term\" is defined in a controlled vocabulary / ontology, and usually corresponds to a class, an individual or a property (entity in OWL, concept in SKOS, resource in RDF). The \"subject\" is the term on the left side of the mapping, and the \"object\" is the term on the right side of the mapping. A \"predicate\" relates the subject with the object and is typically an annotation or object property. A \"mapping set\" is a set of mappings that can be shared using the SSSOM standard. The conceptual model of SSSOM has two main elements: a Mapping and a MappingSet . Some SSSOM metadata elements apply only to one element or the other, but many can be applied to both. Note that some SSSOM metadata elements have known equivalent properties which will be used in the RDF serialisation, for example see_also is mapped to rdfs:seeAlso .

Note that only metadata elements permissible in a global context (G, or L/G) can be used in the metadata-file. We recommend to use the following filename conventions for SSSOM metadatafiles: TSV files should have the extension .sssom.tsv , for example: mp-hp-exact-0.0.1.sssom.tsv . External yaml metadata files should have the extension .sssom.yml , for example mp-hp-exact-0.0.1.sssom.tsv Example ( download ): creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" curie_map: HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" skos: \"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core\" license: \"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" mapping_provider: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno.owl\"","title":"TSV:"},{"location":"spec/#external-mode","text":"In external mode, the mapping set metadata is supplied by a separate YAML file having the same base-name of the mapping file, with the extension -meta.yml .

Apart from being commented, the YAML follows the exact same spec as the YAML specified by the external mode . Heavily used tools in bioinformatics such as pandas allow to specify comment characters when reading CSV files, which makes this option the most user friendly for this community. Additionally, it is a simple unix-level or language-level operation to filter these as a pre-processing in a robust fashion. Note: the mapping set level metadata must be included as a continuous block at the beginning of the file . This means in particular: - No comments can be included that are not part of the metadata data. For example, this is not allowed: Illegal case 1: #creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" # This is a comment that does not belong here #curie_map: # HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" # MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" Illegal case 2: # This is a comment that does not belong here #creator_id: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-1779\" #curie_map: # HP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_\" # MP: \"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_\" There should be no empty rows: the commented yaml files must be directly followed by the column headers.

When the leading hash-symbol is stripped from the header block, the resulting string is: a valid yaml file conforms to SSSOM mapping set specification (only curie_map or a metadata elements that are allowed on mapping_set level, i.e. global ).

In principle, to reach full integration through mappings, you will have to cross-map all ontologies, or semantic spaces (e.g. controlled vocabularies, semantic databases), which means if you have N \"spaces\", you have N x (N - 1) mappings (because A -> B is often different from B -> A). It makes sense to consider mappings as a directed graph from which you can infer other mappings using graph walking or graph traversals . To mitigate the explosion of mappings, we have to be able to cross-walk. While some typical mapping predicates such as owl:equivalentClass or skos:exactMatch are symetric (which means that if A -> B then you can infer B -> A, which we will call a \"walk-back\"), other are not (skos:narrowMatch), but maybe have inverse predicates (A --[skos:narrowMatch]--> B implies B --[skos:broadMatch]--> A). Apart from walk backs, you can infer additional mappings through a chain of subsequent mappings (multi-hop forward walks), for example: - multi-hop forward walks { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304, ncbiprotein:YP_009725304-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627 } --> {PR:000050277 -> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627} ) - walk-backs { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304 } --> {ncbiprotein:YP_009725304 -> PR:000050277} - combinations { PR:000050277 -> ncbiprotein:YP_009725304, ncbiprotein:YP_009725304-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627, MY:NSP8-> uniprot.chain:PRO_0000449627 } --> { PR:000050277 -> MY:NSP8 } To enable cross-walking, we propose the following Five-Star system for mapping sets. 1-Star mappings fulfill the following criteria: record subject id, object id and mapping precision (exact, broad, narrow, close, related) using qualified names (either URIs or CURIEs + curie maps) for subject id and object id using a standard file format (JSON, XML, CSV, TSV) made available in a public space optional : record the subject and object labels to make it easier for humans to read the file 2-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 1-star mappings and furthermore made available in a public version control system with an issue tracker record the semantic predicate explicitly and using qualified names for the semantic predicate (i.e. owl:equivalentClass, skos:exactMatch) record a confidence value for the mapping between 0 and 1 (0 no confidence, 1 100% confidence). record an open license for the use of the mapping set 3-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 2-star mappings and furthermore are exported in SSSOM format record the following additional metadata: match_type (s) (Lexical, Logical match, HumanCurated etc) date of the mapping creator_id subject_source object_source subject_source_version object_source_version mapping_tool if the mapping was automatically computed using a tool 4-Star mappings fulfill all the criteria for 3-star mappings and furthermore register the mapping at a mapping commons record the following additional metadata: mapping_set_id mapping_set_description mapping_set_version mapping_provider (if the mapping is not original, i.e. it is not derived from another source) provide a completely executable curation_rule: if the mapping is Lexical , provide: subject_preprocessing , object_preprocessing subject_match_field , object_match_field match_string if the mapping is Logical , the mapping should be derivable by a reasoner from a combination of the object_source and subject_source . If more is needed then please leave a comment with details. if the mapping is HumanCurated .. (this needs to be fleshed out . For now, leave a comment indicating what you did to arrive at your conclusion, i.e. wether you compared the definitions, looked up the \"labels\" in a database, ran a tool and decided to trust it etc.) if the mapping is SemanticSimilarity (graph similarity, neighbourhood, cosine similarity), you should provide: semantic_similarity_score semantic_similarity_measure For now, if there are multiple pieces of evidence (lexical, logical etc), please emit one row per evidence.
